<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The basic soundness of the method of instruction in Accounting
developed in this book has received substantial demonstration
throughout five years of test. The Introduction to the first edition
contained the following statement regarding the development of the
subject:</p>

<p>“The method of approach as given in this volume is perhaps
not orthodox but it has seemed that the student, given an understanding
of the purpose which the accounting records are to serve,
will be able to make that record with real intelligence instead of
by rule-of-thumb. Accordingly, the balance sheet and the profit
and loss statement are presented first, as the goal towards which
all record-keeping looks. The student is taught to analyze
business facts and conditions from the very beginning. He is
then led, step by step, through the use of non-technical terms,
into the ledger, where he sees the way in which the data which
he has been using are summarized. The books of original entry
are next explained, and the method by which the information is
classified as it is brought onto the books. Finally, the business
papers and documents which constitute the source of all entries
are described.”</p>

<p>To quote again from the original Introduction: “The subject
is developed in such a way that the student knowing something
of bookkeeping has little or no advantage over the one without
such knowledge. This book has been written for the use of
students in our colleges and universities desiring a first course in
accounting. It gives the scope of the work in accounting offered
in the first year of the School of Business of Columbia University.”</p>

<p>The method then advocated and used in a few institutions
has become quite generally accepted. It has justified itself by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
the ease and extent to which students without any previous training in
accounting have grasped the essentials of the subject. Experience with
the book in the classroom, however, and changing ideas with regard
to manner of presentation and sequence of material, have shown as
desirable a rearrangement of some parts and an addition of new material
in places. Accordingly, a systematic revision has been made.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the subject matter of the first portion of the book
has been altered but slightly. The use and function of the balance
sheet and profit and loss statement have been somewhat amplified. The
working sheet has been introduced earlier than in the first edition
to afford an easy summary of the period’s results. It should later on
be made a part of the regular work of summarization. The controlling
account is also explained earlier so as to afford more practice in its
use. The accounting features of the partnership and of the corporation
are given continuous treatment. Here a new chapter has been added,
which discusses certain features of the corporation not treated in
the original book such as the issue and sale of treasury stock and of
bonds, bond interest as related to premium and discount, sinking fund,
sinking fund reserve, redemption of bonds, etc.</p>

<p>The material presented in the last quarter of the book deals with
the interrelations of accounting, financial management, buying, and
marketing. Thus the chapters dealing with the handling of cash, notes
receivable and payable, cash discounts, and balance sheet valuation,
treat of the relations between accounting and financial management.
Several chapters at the end treat of some special methods of accounting
practice and of the basic principles of single entry. In this portion
of the book new chapters on balance sheet valuation and on buying have
been added.</p>

<p>Entirely new problem material has been furnished, carefully graded and
related so far as possible to the subject matter of the chapters of the
text. For the convenience of the student this material is separated
from the text, and grouped in three appendices. A few of the problems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
have been drawn from the examinations of various state boards and the
regents of the University of the State of New York, and from other
miscellaneous sources, to all of which acknowledgment is due. The
author is indebted to Mr. George B. Kelley for assistance in building
up a large part of the practice material. It need hardly be said that
a fundamentally sound knowledge of accounting cannot be gained without
ample practice work. Theory can never be sure of itself until put to
the test of practice.</p>

<p>The author desires to acknowledge again his debt to the many friends
whose counsel and aid counted so largely in the first writing of
this book. In the revision he finds himself still further indebted
to many instructors in all sections of the country for criticism and
suggestion. He desires especially to express his appreciation of
the active co-operation of his associates on the Columbia staff of
instructors in First Year Accounting, in particular Miss Nina Miller
and Messrs. Ralph T. Bickell and E. Gaylord Davis. In the actual work
of revision Messrs. Eskholme Wade, John Jaffee, and Raymond Gatchell
have given valuable assistance.

<p><b>Records and Their Functions.</b>—As far back as our knowledge
reaches, records of some sort have been kept and used and they have
frequently formed the basis on which our knowledge rests. In a broad
sense a record may be defined as a written memorial, a register
or history of events, a testimony. Even though the desire to make
and hand on to the future a record of achievement is a deep-seated
characteristic, record-making has seldom been an end in itself.
Knowledge of what has been done has always been a starting point and
a guide for future achievement. The longhand or narrative record
is indispensable in some fields of knowledge; the shorthand or
statistical record is equally necessary in others. The statistical
method and accounting are, without question, most potent agencies
for the advancement of human knowledge and for the control of human
relationships. They provide the basis in fact on which judgments must
largely rest. This book, therefore, may begin by sketching the relation
of accounting to some of the larger fields of human endeavor—the
economic organization of society and the law—to point out its place in
the business unit and briefly state the basic function it performs therein.</p>

<p><b>The Business Unit.</b>—To carry on its various activities, economic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
society has organized itself into numberless separate units or
business organizations. These units are the means through which
society operates, their ultimate purpose being the easy and efficient
satisfaction of human economic wants. Individual business units,
conducted as they are by members of society, are under the broad
general supervision of society as a whole. This is evidenced everywhere
by the laws, licenses, and regulations by which society attempts to
regulate the activities of the individual for the larger interest of
society as a whole. As business is conducted in most parts of the
world, it is highly individualized rather than communized. There is a
growing tendency, however, for society to exercise a larger control and
supervision over all types of individual activity, particularly with
a view to conserving the welfare of its members. The business unit is
thus the medium through which society works to satisfy its economic wants.</p>

<p><b>Internal Organization of the Business Unit.</b>—Society early
found that only by means of a highly specialized division of its
activities was it possible to satisfy without waste its rapidly
increasing economic wants. Individual business units are thus organized
for the purpose of carrying on some one or more of these greatly
subdivided activities. Within itself the business unit is organized
into departments or divisions for the efficient and thrifty handling
of its work. The two large divisions in any business undertaking have
to do with what the economist calls the production and exchange of
wealth, that is, commodities, services, and so forth. In carrying
on these activities of production and exchange it has usually been
found desirable to segregate into separate departments certain major
functions which are common both to production and to exchange. What
the major departments may be depends very largely upon the size of the
business unit, its relative complexity of organization, and to some
extent on the individual ideas of its managers. Throughout the business
world one notes, however, a quite general departmentization under the
following heads:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">1. Finance</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Procurement or production</li>
<li class="isub2">3. Marketing or distribution</li>
<li class="isub2">4. Personnel</li>
<li class="isub2">5. General administration</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two main activities under the control of the finance division
of a business: (a) the problem of original investment, including that
of location and acquisition of a plant suitable for the conduct of
a contemplated business; and (b) the problem of operating finance,
that is, of providing the business with a fund of working capital for
its efficient operation. The financing of purchases, sales, credits,
operating expenses, and so forth, comprises a large part of the work of
finance of an operating or going concern.</p>

<p>In the second of the major departments, that of procurement or
production, one finds these activities: (a) the purchasing of the
stock-in-trade to be dealt in, if the concern is a trading business;
or (b) the manufacture of the stock-in-trade, if the concern is a
manufacturing business.</p>

<p>In the department of marketing or distribution, the following
activities center: (a) those having for their purpose the creation of
a market or demand for the commodity dealt in—the sales organization,
the advertising activities, and so forth; (b) the actual selling of the
commodity; and (c) the transportation and delivery of the product.</p>

<p>In the personnel department are included the human relations between
employer and employee. The hiring and training of the employee, his
classification and rating, his welfare and promotion, are the major
activities here.</p>

<p>The function of the department of general administration is in the
main that of supervision and management of the business as a whole.
The general manager must have a view of all of the activities of the
business. He must see that the various departments through which its
activities are carried on are properly correlated, that it is so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
organized that its departments function smoothly and efficiently in
the performance of their several duties. A consideration of the means
employed by the general manager for the proper performance of his duty
indicates the place of accounting in the business unit.</p>

<p><b>Place of Accounting in Business.</b>—In a small business where the
owner and manager is in close and intimate contact with these several
departments, or perhaps where he focuses all of them within himself, he
has no need of special means of keeping himself informed concerning the
activities of his assistants, nor does he require an elaborate system
of records to indicate the condition and state of the business at any
time. In large businesses, however, where the volume and complexity of
the commercial activities make it impossible for the executive, on whom
rest the responsibilities for the successful conduct of the business,
to have an intimate personal knowledge of all phases of the business,
it is very necessary that some means be employed for supplying him
with this vital information. Two types of information are necessary to
him: (1) information about the business unit itself, its activities
and condition; and (2) information about general economic conditions
in the country, and particularly about other businesses in the same
line of activity as his own. It is the function of accounting to supply
information of the first type; it is the chief purpose of statistics
to supply information of the second type. The accounting department,
therefore, deals largely with the internal activities of the business,
while the statistical department provides knowledge of the external
relations of the business. A proper control and management of business
affairs cannot be exercised without the information supplied by both
departments. In the accomplishment of its function to supply the
internal information, the accounting department reaches out into all of
the main departments indicated above for data from which to make its
record of the various activities of the business unit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p><b>Purpose of Accounts.</b>—Accounts record the business history
of a concern. Their main purpose is to secure information
concerning the results of business activity and endeavor. The
record required for this purpose can be condensed and made very
brief, although the full history of every business comprises a
multitude of transactions with a great mass of details. The
whole scheme and method of account-keeping is designed chiefly
to collect the detail and use it mainly for building up a summary
which shall give in rapid review the entire record for the fiscal
period.</p>

<p>Account-keeping is to the bookkeeper what shorthand is to
the stenographer—an abbreviated method of making the record.
The uses to which the records are put, however, differ radically.
Stenography abbreviates the writing of the spoken word with
a view to its transcription into longhand; accounting records
business transactions in abbreviated form with a view to summarizing
them further so as to secure a bird’s-eye view of the
operations of the business as a whole and to use it in the formulation
of administrative judgments and policies.</p>

<p>In a large business there are executive duties within each of
the five main departments. Accounting must supply the information
on which each departmental executive will base his
judgments and policies. The student will see, therefore, that
the accounting department brings together a record of the
activities of each of the main departments of a business. He
will see, too, how the final output or product of the accounting
department must be a summarization and interpretation of these
departmental activities in order to provide a basis for the various
executives on which to formulate their judgments and business
policies. Accounting is, therefore, a handmaiden of the executives
in the conduct and management of the business. It is the
purpose of this volume to develop the technique of the bookkeeping
and accounting record and to indicate some of its uses in the
management of business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><b>Relation of Accountancy to Economics.</b>—Economics is sometimes
defined as the science of wealth, by which is meant a body of
classified knowledge relating to wealth in the aggregate. Under the
present-day political and social system, the ownership of wealth is
very largely private. Furthermore, the division of labor, as industry
is now organized, has been carried to a very high degree. Because of
these facts the present elaborate organizations for producing wealth
have given rise to an urgent need for some effective means of keeping
record of their activities.</p>

<p>The effort of every individual engaged in industry is to increase
wealth. He labors to extract the raw materials from nature, to shape
and mould them so as to supply the wants of his fellowmen. He then
distributes them by means of markets and exchanges so as to secure the
greatest possible returns for his effort. As competition becomes keener
and the margin of return per unit of product becomes smaller, he has to
increase his volume of business to secure the same amount of profit as
when he did a lesser volume of business.</p>

<p>To produce goods it is necessary to use the saved wealth of former
periods to pay the expenses of materials, labor, management, etc., of
the present period. One must consume wealth to produce wealth. After
his product is made, he must seek the best market for its exchange or
sale. This necessitates the use of a complex system of transportation
and communication. Finally, during the whole process of production and
exchange the estimated returns from the article must be distributed
among the several parties engaged in their creation. To make this
distribution on the basis of estimated returns, gives rise to the
need—the absolute necessity—of an accurate record of the costs of
the activities and processes all along the line. The record, then, of
the value of the rights and properties of the various parties to the
production and distribution of wealth, as society is now organized for
its economic well being, is the special field assigned to Accountancy
as related to Economics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p><b>Relation of Accountancy to Law.</b>—The determination of the
rights of the several parties to the creation, exchange, and ultimate
consumption of a product is the field of Law, more particularly
Business Law. The determination by means of its records of the value
and extent of these rights is the province of Accountancy as related to
Law. Accountancy is thus seen to be the handmaiden of both Economics
and Law. None of them can progress far without the help of the other
two. All being related to, and arising out of manifold human endeavors,
their progress and development is dependent upon, and limited only by,
the progress of these endeavors.</p>

<p><b>The Fundamental Problem of Accountancy.</b>—The aim of all
private businesses being the increase of wealth, the first problem of
accountancy is to determine how much wealth is invested in a given
enterprise and what ownership or proprietorship exists at given
periods, so that by comparison the increases and decreases in the
proprietorship may be known. When accurate information is obtained, an
intelligent plan of action can be adopted to remedy such ills of the
business as are shown and to increase any profitable line of activity.
Accordingly, proprietorship and its changing values are the basic
problems of accountancy as well as of business.</p>

<p><b>Definition of Terms.</b>—Before proceeding to a definition or
determination of proprietorship, it is necessary to understand what is
meant by the terms “assets” and “liabilities.” The root idea of the
word “assets” is “sufficiency.” Specifically, assets are the “entire
property of all sorts, of a person, association, or corporation
applicable or subject to the payment of debts.” Similarly, the
liabilities of a person, firm, or corporation are his or its pecuniary
obligations or debts. Proprietorship is the difference between the
value of the assets and the amount of the liabilities, and is defined
and measured by the equation:</p>

<p class="f120"><b>Assets - Liabilities = Proprietorship</b></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
This proprietorship equation is a basic formula. It is also written:</p>

<p class="f120"><b>Assets = Liabilities + Proprietorship</b></p>

<p class="no-indent">It will thus be seen that proprietorship
represents the equity of the owners of an enterprise in its assets.
The assets are first applied in paying the claims of creditors of the
business, and whatever of them remains belongs to the owners of the
business.</p>

<p><b>Development of the Proprietorship Equation—The Balance
Sheet.</b>—To indicate the basis of the standard form of the
proprietorship equation, several illustrations will be given. The
equation is in its simplest form when it indicates proprietorship in a
new business immediately after the owner has invested cash to provide
the business with capital. For example, assume that on January 1, 19—,
James T. Runyon starts business by investing $5,000 cash capital in the
enterprise.</p>

<p>Here the proprietorship equation is:</p>

<p class="f120">Assets (cash $5,000) = Proprietorship ($5,000)</p>

<p class="space-below1">As yet there are no liabilities. However,
in order to carry on his business, Runyon must purchase a stock of
merchandise and equipment for his store. Accordingly, he purchases
store furniture and fixtures from Lowell Brothers for $500, of which
he pays $250 in cash, and owes the balance. He also buys a stock of
groceries for $2,500 from Reid Murdock &amp; Co. on 10 days’ time.
He now has more assets than the original $5,000 cash, but he has
become indebted for the additional amount, so that the amount of his
proprietorship has not changed—as is shown by the following equation,
somewhat more complex than the first:</p>

Runyon now begins operations and after six months finds that his
activities have comprised the purchase of delivery equipment for
$300 cash; sale of goods amounting to $6,000; the payment of $1,000
cash for rent, clerk hire, and advertising; and sundry purchases of
stock-in-trade and other items as needed. As a result he now has $1,000
cash on hand; customers owe him $3,000; his stock of goods still on
hand is worth $2,100; he owes creditors $1,000 for goods bought and his
clerks $50 for services rendered.</p>

<p>It is readily seen that as the number of assets and liabilities
increases, the method of showing them that was used above becomes
awkward and cumbersome; therefore, still using the equation, we make
the following vertical tabulation to determine and show proprietorship:</p>

<p>This method of expressing the proprietorship equation is called a
“Balance Sheet,” or “Financial Statement.”</p>

<p>Further analysis of the above information discloses the amount of
Runyon’s purchases and of his payments to creditors. Taking the
transactions involving cash, we find that he had $5,000 to start with
and received $3,000 from sales, or $8,000 in all. He bought furniture
and delivery equipment for $800, and paid expenses of $1,000, in all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
$1,800. There is therefore a balance of $6,200 to be accounted for.
$1,000 cash is still on hand, so that he must have paid creditors
$5,200. Since he still owes creditors $1,000 for goods bought, his
purchases must have been in all $6,200.</p>

<p>The ability to make accounting statements and to analyze accounting
data for various purposes constitutes a very important part of the
equipment of the accountant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND CAPITAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before discussing the form and content of the balance sheet and some
of its major uses, the chief classes of assets, liabilities, and
proprietorship or capital will be explained so that the student will
have an intelligent notion of what is meant by each asset, liability,
and capital item.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Assets.</b>—Accounting terms are not wholly standard.
An account title is often used in one business to include items not
mentioned under that title in another business. One finds also terms
and titles peculiar to particular businesses. However, there is a
tendency towards a standardization of the terms used in balance sheets.
It is the purpose here to present and explain those which are common to
practically all businesses. These include the asset titles Cash, Notes
Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Merchandise, Investments, Deferred
Charges or Expense Assets, Furniture and Fixtures, Delivery Equipment,
Buildings, and Land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cash.</span> Cash includes all kinds of money
and usually whatever serves as a medium of exchange, which is in the
possession or control of the business—deposits in banks, moneys in the
safe and cash drawers, and sometimes funds in the possession of agents.
Checks received in the regular course of business and not yet deposited
in the bank are usually classified as cash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notes Receivable.</span> The formal promises to
pay, made by others for debts owed the business, are classified under
the general title Notes Receivable. Time drafts drawn on the debtors of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the business and accepted by them may be included
under this title, although they are sometimes shown under a separate
title, such as Acceptances Receivable. This is particularly true when
the acceptances are trade acceptances. It will be seen later that the
promissory note has a somewhat different legal status from the open
account claim against a debtor, and should therefore be classified
under such title as will indicate the exact nature of the item.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accounts Receivable.</span> These usually
represent the claims of the business against its trade customers for
goods sold on open account and not paid for. The term is, however,
broader than this, being sometimes used—although the practice is to be
deplored—to include all claims against debtors except those which are
in the form of notes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Merchandise.</span> This asset represents
the stock-in-trade in which the business deals. It is of course a
sort of revolving asset, that is, merchandise is purchased and sold
continuously, so that the stock-in-trade is constantly being turned
over. The rate of turnover is very important, as will later be seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Investments.</span> This asset represents the
stocks and bonds of other companies, municipalities, school districts,
and so forth, owned by the business. As a usual thing there are seasons
of the year when the cash funds of a business are built up and lie idle
in the bank unless they are invested in securities of some sort. These
securities can be reconverted into cash when the business requires a
larger fund of cash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deferred Charges.</span> Certain types of
expenditure are necessary in every business to secure operating
supplies. Fuel must be purchased for heating and power purposes;
brooms, oil, waste, and other similar supplies are needed for cleaning
and maintaining the business plant; stationery, stamps, wrapping paper,
twine, cartons, packing materials, and so forth must always be on hand;
insurance policies giving protection against fire are usually purchased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
for from one to three years and so are seldom completely used up at
any given date. All items of this sort, necessary for the operation of
the business but not dealt in as stock-in-trade, are called “expense
assets.” The portions of these assets on hand at a given time, the
use of which will be deferred to a later period, are classified as
“deferred charges.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Furniture and Fixtures.</span> A business plant
must be equipped with furniture and fixtures suitable for the display
of the stock-in-trade, for the accommodation of customers, for the
care and protection of the necessary records of the business, for the
efficient performance of duties by the employees, and for other similar
purposes. Assets of this type which are not a permanent part of the
business plant but are removable should the business desire to change
location, are listed under the title of Furniture and Fixtures. This
may be subdivided to suit conditions. Sometimes several titles—Store
Furniture and Fixtures, Office Furniture and Fixtures, Factory
Furniture and Fixtures, Machinery and Tools—are used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delivery Equipment.</span> If a business
delivers its commodities it will usually have its own delivery
equipment. This may comprise horses, wagons, harness, automobile
trucks, and so forth. The delivery equipment may be used for both
inbound and outbound deliveries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buildings.</span> All buildings owned by the
business, whether used for business purposes or not, will usually be
classified under the asset title Buildings. Store, office, factory,
warehouses, residences owned and rented to employees—all assets of this
type are to be listed here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> This item represents land—city
lots, plant sites, and so forth—owned in fee simple or subject to
mortgage. Sometimes when a plot of land is leased for a term of years
and a lump sum payment made at the beginning of the lease, the asset
may be included either under the title Land, or under the broader title
Land and Leaseholds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p><b>Kinds of Liabilities.</b>—Just as with assets, there is
not entire uniformity in terminology for the various classes of
liabilities. The more common types of items met with are: Notes
Payable, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Mortgages Payable, Bonds
Payable, and so forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notes Payable.</span> These represent the formal
promises to pay, signed by the business or its owners. They represent
the formal claims of others, that is, creditors, against the business.
Just as with notes receivable, it is sometimes desirable to make a
more distinct classification of notes payable. In such cases the
titles Acceptances Payable, Trade Acceptances Payable, Long-Term Notes
Payable, etc., are used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accounts Payable.</span> Under this title are
listed the liabilities to creditors on open account, as distinguished
from those formally acknowledged by a written promise to pay. These
include obligations to trade creditors for merchandise, supplies,
equipment, and property of almost any kind purchased for use by the
business. In a broad sense an account payable includes any item for
which the business is liable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accrued Expenses.</span> Accrued Expenses
represent usually the accumulating but unpaid claims against the
business for service rendered it, as distinguished from the Accounts
Payable, which usually represent purchases of an asset of one kind
or another. Thus the amounts due at a given time to employees for
work done since the last date of payment of their wages, salaries,
or commissions, to the landowner for the rent of leased premises, to
lenders for interest on moneys borrowed, are items properly to be
listed under this title.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mortgages Payable.</span> These represent the
claims of creditors against particular properties owned by the business
but against which the creditors have been given a lien or preferred
claim as security for the borrowed or unpaid amount. Mortgages are
evidenced by a formal legal document and are usually recorded in the
county clerk’s office.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonds Payable.</span> These are a type of
long-term mortgage which is split into lots of more or less standard
amount and so made available to a larger number of holders than is
usually the case with the ordinary mortgage payable. This type of
liability is limited almost exclusively to corporations.</p>

<p>The student should realize that usually the owner or owners of a
business enterprise have both assets and liabilities other than those
employed in the business. These personal properties and obligations
of the owners are not to be taken into account when showing the
proprietorship of a business unit or enterprise. They are to be
considered only in showing the total proprietorship of any individual
owner, when of course all of his properties, both inside and outside of
the business, must be listed.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Proprietorship.</b>—Proprietorship, called also Net
Worth, is shown under such titles as Capital, Investment, Capital
Stock, Surplus, Undivided Profits, Reserves, and so forth. The title
used depends largely on the type of organization under which the
business is operated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capital.</span> Under this title is shown the
amount of the investment of each owner in a single proprietorship or
partnership business. To show each owner’s share in the ownership the
title Capital is preceded by his name. Illustration of this is given on
pages <a href="#Page_19">19 and 20</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Investment.</span> This title usually is
synonymous with capital. Sometimes it is used to indicate the amount of
original investment in the business as distinguished from the present
investment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capital Stock.</span> Under this title is
indicated the sum total of the portions of net worth owned by the
shareholders as evidenced by stock certificates and subject to their
individual control. On <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a> is given an explanation
of the way in which the proprietorship or net worth of a corporation may be
composed of two (or more) parts: (1) the capital paid in by the owners; and (2)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the capital, representing profits made but not distributed to the
owners. While capital stock usually represents the capital contributed
by the owners, it sometimes arises from other sources, such as the
distribution of a stock dividend; but the portion of the net worth
owned and controlled individually by the owners is the capital
stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surplus.</span> In a corporation this represents
the second portion of the net worth, as indicated in the preceding
section. Surplus is sometimes defined as the excess of the net worth
over the capital stock. In other words, it is the difference between
the assets and the sum of the liabilities and the capital stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Undivided Profits.</span> This is a term used
chiefly in financial institutions to indicate the portion of the net
profits concerning the disposal of which no action has been taken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reserves.</span> Under this title are included
whatever portions of the surplus are set aside or reserved for specific
purposes.</p>

<p>Where Surplus, Undivided Profits, and Reserves appear as parts of
Net Worth, they together represent the difference between Net Worth and
Capital Stock. The reason for the careful segregation of these items
from the Capital Stock is given in the explanation of the corporate
form of organization, on <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>.</p>

<p><b>Types of Business Organization.</b>—Before proceeding with a
discussion of proprietorship as it appears on the balance sheet, the
three general types of business organization will be treated briefly,
because the manner of indicating proprietorship is dependent to a
certain extent on the type of organization. These types are: (1)
the single or sole proprietorship, (2) the partnership, and (3) the
corporation.</p>

<p><b>The Single Proprietorship.</b>—The simplest form of business
enterprise is that conducted by a single proprietor. This form is
well adapted to businesses where the capital necessary for efficient
production is small, where the processes are simple and capable of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
being handled by the average individual, and where the risks are
slight. Very few legal obstacles are placed in the way of the
individual desiring to go into business for himself, nor is a great
deal required of him. In some cases registration and a license are
necessary. The observance of the general laws, concerning the payment
of taxes and of local regulations concerning disease and fire is
all that is usually expected. Subject to the general restrictions
which ordinary business acumen and foresight impose, one can enter
practically any field of enterprise, as a single proprietor, have
entire freedom and privacy in the conduct of his business, and share
with none the results of his endeavor.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these conditions oftentimes prove to be decided
disadvantages. As industry is at present organized, many fields of
activity demanding large capital and many kinds of technical knowledge,
are closed to the single proprietor. Freedom of action carries with it
sole responsibility, and oftentimes the counsel and advice of others
would prevent the disasters which sometimes overtake the single owner
of a business.</p>

<p><b>The Partnership.</b>—A partnership is “a contract of two or more
legally competent persons to combine their money, property, skill,
and labor, or some or all of them, for the prosecution of some lawful
business and to divide the profits and bear the losses in certain
proportions.” There are different kinds of partnerships, as will later
be shown, but the essence of each from the point of view of a working
organization is mutual agency, each partner being the agent of the
others, and, within the limitations of the partnership agreement,
capable of acting as a principal for the firm. The partnership is
subject to practically as few restrictions as the individual. In some
localities, to secure the right to sue and be sued in the firm name, it
is necessary to file in a public office a brief statement of the firm
name and the names of its members.</p>

<p>The chief advantages of the partnership are larger capital and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
therefore access to fields closed to the individual; the combining of
the business wisdom, skill, and knowledge of several individuals; the
subdivision of duties and therefore the opportunity for specialization.
While in the view of the business community the partnership is an
entity or a business unit, it is not so in the sight of the law, each
member of the firm being held liable to creditors for the entire debts
of the partnership as if it were his sole business. If any one member
has to pay the firm debts, he has a claim against his copartners for
contribution.</p>

<p>Some of the disadvantages of this type of organization are the
possibility of friction among the partners and consequent delay of
action; the extension to the firm of credit based not on the firm
property but rather on the total property of the members, and the
consequent liability of each partner and his entire private fortune for
the debts of the firm.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the partnership agreement should be very
carefully drawn to cover in detail the relations of the partners, their
duties and their rights, particularly as to their shares in the profits
or losses of the firm.</p>

<p><b>The Corporation.</b>—The corporate type of business organization is
distinguished from the other types discussed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. By the freedom of each owner from the personal
liability for the debts of the business to any greater extent than
his stock interest in the business, though frequently in financial
corporations, and in a few states for all corporations, his liability
is double that stated.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. By each share of ownership being evidenced by
a formal document called a certificate of stock.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. By each owner being allowed a voice in the
affairs of the business only to the extent of his stock ownership
therein.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. By the necessity of securing from the proper
authorities permission to do business.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. By the necessity of complying strictly with
the terms of this permit and submitting to certain requirements such
as the filing of annual reports, payment of special taxes, and the
like.</p>
</div>

<p>The owners of a corporation, or its stockholders as they are called,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
conduct the business through a board of directors which they elect
for that purpose and they review its management periodically, usually
annually. In this way they exercise indirect supervision over the
business. This remoteness of personal interest and supervision has
been somewhat overcome by electing to the board only those largely
interested in the business, and by retaining on the board those whose
ability as managers has been tried and proved. The board usually hires
and delegates to others the active management of affairs.</p>

<p>The advantages of the corporate form of organization are: (1) it
limits the liability of its owners; (2) it lends itself well to
accumulation of the large funds of capital necessary for the promotion
of large-scale enterprises; and (3) it secures through its board of
directors a convenient and effective means of centralized control and
management.</p>

<p><b>Showing the Proprietorship of These Types</b>.—The methods of
showing in the balance sheet the proprietorship for these three types
of organization differ somewhat. The title under which proprietorship
is listed is Capital. In a single proprietorship such title is preceded
by the proprietor’s name, as shown in the following illustration:</p>

<p>In a corporation, proprietorship is shown by the aggregate of the
outstanding shares of stock, which are valued at a fixed par, or cost,
under the single title Capital Stock, and if the proprietorship is
greater than that indicated under this title, the excess is listed
separately under the title Surplus or some of the other proprietorship
titles already explained. This method of showing proprietorship is
prescribed by law and is an effort to inform creditors, or those who
may become creditors, that the corporation has observed the legal
requirement not to distribute to stockholders any of its original
capital. Hence, the capital stock of the corporation must be listed
separately from the other items of proprietorship. Any changes in
proprietorship during the life of the corporation are taken care of
under these other titles, somewhat as illustrated below.

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE BALANCE SHEET</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Purpose and Use.</b>—The balance sheet of a business is designed
to show its financial condition at a given time. As previously
illustrated, it marshals the assets in one list or schedule, and the
liabilities in another. The difference between the totals of the two
schedules gives the present or net worth of the business. In compiling
a balance sheet it is not sufficient to give simply the figures of
proprietorship or net worth; schedules of assets and liabilities must
be drawn up to show the items making up that net worth. From the
viewpoint of a prospective investor or purchaser, a banker to whom
the business has applied for a loan, or a concern considering the
advisability of extending it credit on a bill of goods, it makes all
the difference in the world to know that with a net value of $10,000
the business has assets of $15,000 and liabilities of $5,000; or to
know that its assets are $260,000 and its liabilities $250,000.</p>

<p>The ratio of total assets to total liabilities is almost as important
information to an investor, purchaser, banker, or creditor as is
the character of the assets and liabilities. If the assets are in
properties for which there is not a ready market and the liabilities
are claims which mature soon and will have to be met, the situation
is unfavorable. If there are large values invested in easily salable
assets; if there is a large balance of cash on hand after meeting
current claims and providing for those which will soon mature; if
other liabilities are of a more permanent nature, such as mortgages or
long-time notes not requiring immediate attention—the situation may
show evidence of too large a capital, or of inefficient management as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
indicated by the failure to invest a part of the surplus cash in
properties from which some return might be secured.</p>

<p><b>Form and Content.</b>—Questions of the kind raised above are not
usually capable of definite answer from the information contained on
the balance sheet alone. Oftentimes information as to the volume of
business done, future plans for expansion or contraction of business
operations, and so forth, is needed in addition to that supplied by the
balance sheet. Of immediate interest to us, however, is the information
contained in the balance sheet. Here two main problems are met: that
relating to the form of the balance sheet, and that concerned with the
content of the balance sheet.</p>

<p>By form of the balance sheet is meant its physical appearance—the
arrangement and classification of its items. The form is not standard.
In this country there are few legal regulations governing the way in
which the records of a business are to be kept or its reports are to
be made. Some efforts have been made, however, to establish a more or
less standard form of balance sheet and to secure the use of standard
titles in the balance sheet so that wherever found those titles can be
relied upon to mean one and only one thing. Because balance sheets are
not always drawn up for similar purposes, such regulations should not
be too inflexible. The form of any business statement or report should
always have regard to the purposes it is to serve. Standardization of
form is desirable within this limitation.</p>

<p>By content of the balance sheet is meant the items that are admitted
to it and the basis of their valuation.</p>

<p>These two problems of the balance sheet—form and content—are
fundamental and will be briefly considered here.</p>

<p><b>Titles—Main and Group.</b>—Instead of “Balance Sheet,” other
terms are used as names for the statement itself, such as “Financial
Statement,” “Statement of Resources and Liabilities,” “Statement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Assets and Liabilities.” Within the statement, Resources is an
alternative title for Assets; and Net Worth, Present Worth, and Net
Assets, for Proprietorship. For the present, use of the terminology
previously employed will be continued, with the substitution, however,
of the term Net Worth for Proprietorship.</p>

<p>The title of a statement should be full; it should include the name of
the business enterprise and date, and should appear somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">Shongood</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Goodwell<br />
Balance Sheet</span><br />December 31, 19—</p>

<p>As stated, this should be followed by the schedules of Assets,
Liabilities, and Net Worth. Since the statement is a formal one, due
regard should be had for its general appearance, which should be neat
and attractive. Further consideration will be given to some of these
features in Chapters <a href="#Page_213">XXVI</a> and <a href="#Page_221">XXVII</a>.</p>

<p><b>Classification and Arrangement.</b>—As indicated above, the balance
sheet is used to picture the financial condition of a business at
a given time. Some of the questions which arise in determining the
financial condition of a business have already been mentioned. The
chief use to which a balance sheet is put is the determination of the
solvency of the business for purposes of getting credit extensions. By
solvency is meant the ability of the business to pay its debts when
due. Regardless of how great the excess of assets over liabilities
is, if it is tied up in assets which cannot be used for the payment
of debts, the creditors of the business will become impatient and may
ask a court to take the control of the business away from its owners
and place it in the hands of a representative of the court and the
creditors, who will conduct the business for the purpose of converting
assets into cash to a sufficient extent to pay all debts.</p>

<p>A balance sheet should therefore be so arranged that the condition of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the business, viewed from the standpoint of its ability to pay its
debts, will be clearly and easily determinable. Cash is usually the
only medium used for the payment of debts. In the regular course of
business, debts are incurred which come due at different dates. Hence
it is not necessary to have on hand at a given time cash sufficient
to pay all of the debts of the business. Certain classes of debts
will not wait. The sums owed employees for services must usually be
paid when due. The debt to the government for taxes, to the public
service company for heat, light, and power, to the landlord for rent,
to the bank for money borrowed—all these debts must usually be paid
immediately as they come due.</p>

<p>The cycle of business operation includes the purchase of merchandise,
the payment of operating expenses, and the conversion of merchandise
into cash through sale, either directly, as when the sale is for cash,
or indirectly as when credit is extended a customer and cash is later
collected from him. This cycle or turnover of merchandise recurs
constantly in the management of the financial affairs of a business.
It is necessary so to order the buying and selling of goods and the
collection of accounts from customers that there will be on hand at all
times sufficient cash to pay the expenses of operating the business and
the debts contracted in the purchase of merchandise. This is the vital
and fundamental problem of the business executive. In the solution
of that problem it may sometimes be necessary to borrow funds from
the bank. Before lending money, the banker assures himself that the
business will be in a position to repay the borrowed money when due.</p>

<p>The balance sheet, accordingly, should be so arranged that the
condition of the business as related to its ability to pay its debts
will be apparent. This requires a classification or marshaling of the
assets which are concerned in the trading cycle on the one side, and
the liabilities which must be assumed in conducting the business during
the trading cycle, on the other.</p>

<p>At the head of the list of assets is the item Cash, the most liquid of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
all, as it can be used directly for the payment of debts. Following
Cash come in order Notes Receivable, which, with proper indorsement,
can be sold to the banker and converted into cash almost immediately;
Accounts Receivable, which represent the claims against customers for
merchandise sold and which are collectible within the term of credit
extended to the customer; and finally, the Merchandise on Hand, which
must be sold either for cash or on credit and then converted into
cash by the collection of the outstanding accounts. Sometimes, also,
there is included in this group the asset Investments, representing
stocks and bonds of other companies which can be converted into cash
by sale on a stock exchange. On such securities, and also on the
notes receivable, there is usually at the date of the balance sheet
some interest which has accrued and may not yet be collectible. It is
customary to include the amount of this interest receivable in the same
group with the assets from which it arises.</p>

<p>This group of assets, comprising Cash, Notes and Accounts Receivable,
Merchandise, and so forth, is called the group of Current Assets. Asset
items are classified as current if conversion into cash is expected
within three to six months. These are the assets to which the current
creditors of the business will have to look for the payment of their
claims.</p>

<p>The claims of current creditors are usually included under the titles
Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, and Accrued or Unpaid Expenses. The
classification of a creditor in the current liability group is usually
determined on a time basis. Thus, all debts that will have to be met
within six months’ or one year’s time from the date of the balance
sheet are usually classed as Current Liabilities.</p>

<p>The excess of current assets over current liabilities is called the
working capital of the business; that is, an amount of the current
assets equal to the current liabilities will have to be used for the
payment of these debts, leaving the excess or difference free for use
within the business. While it is not possible to determine, without
considering all the circumstances in a given case, how large this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
working capital should be, the standard rule-of-thumb is that it should
equal the amount of the current liabilities. It will thus be seen that
the standard ratio of current assets to current liabilities is two to
one. The solvency of a given business is always judged by a comparison
of the current asset group with the current liability group.</p>

<p>The next main group of assets is given the title Deferred Charges.
The content of this item was explained on <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>.
Thus, if a management has paid some of its expense bills in
advance—rent for January paid during December, for example—when showing
its financial condition as at the end of December it is proper and
necessary, in order to make an accurate showing, that all such prepaid
expenses be listed as assets; for, had the payment not been made until
the service which it purchased had been used up, the asset cash would
have been larger by the amount of the prepaid expenses.</p>

<p>Similarly, with regard to the Accrued Expenses mentioned on <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>,
whatever expenses have been incurred that properly belong to the past
period, such as wages due but unpaid, are liabilities; for the cash
would be smaller by the amount of such postponed or accrued items had
the claims been met during the period. The close relationship of both
deferred charges and accrued expenses to cash is thus apparent—the one
as an indirect addition to the cash, the other as an indirect deduction
from or claim against cash. Accordingly, deferred charges are shown on
the balance sheet immediately following the group of current assets,
whereas accrued expenses are listed with the current liabilities as
noted above.</p>

<p>The next group of assets is called Fixed Assets. Under this title are
listed those assets which are used for carrying on the business but
are not bought for the purpose of being resold. A certain amount of
capital must be invested in the physical business plant. Furniture and
fixtures, delivery equipment, buildings, land, machinery and tools, and
so forth, must be purchased before the business can commence operating.
It is assets of this type that comprise the class of fixed assets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
There is a corresponding group among the liabilities which are known
as Fixed or Long-Term Liabilities. All debts maturing a year or more
after the date of the balance sheet are classed as fixed liabilities.
As examples of this class, we have long-term notes payable, mortgages
payable, bonds payable, and so forth.</p>

<p>The difference between the fixed assets and the fixed liabilities
indicates the amount of owner’s capital which has been invested in the
business plant.</p>

<p>The final group of assets is called simply Other Assets, and includes
all assets which cannot be classified in any other groups, such as
good-will, patents, trade-marks, accounts and notes receivable having a
credit term longer than six months, and other similar items. If there
are any liabilities not capable of classification in the two groups
of liabilities given above, they may be put in a group called Other
Liabilities.</p>

<p>For the purpose of an easy showing of these various groups and their
titles, it is customary to list the amounts of the several detailed
items of each group in an inner money column, and to extend the total
into the adjoining money column on the line of the last item in the
group. A similar arrangement is made of the groups of liabilities so
that not only the items in the various groups but the group totals as
well are available. The totals of the various groups give the grand
totals for the assets and the liabilities respectively.</p>

<p>The balance sheet as now classified and arranged provides first a
formal title, giving the name of the business and the date of the
balance sheet; then the assets, under which appear the groups Current
Assets, Deferred Charges, Fixed Assets, and Other Assets; under the
liabilities appear the groups Current Liabilities, Fixed Liabilities,
and Other Liabilities. The showing of Proprietorship or Net Worth under
the three different kinds of ownership has already been set forth. The
illustration on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a> shows a typical form of
classified balance sheet. This should be studied carefully, as it is
the type which will be used hereafter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p><b>The Problem of Content.</b>—The form of the balance sheet serves
the purpose of making easily available the information contained in the
balance sheet. Form is of little value unless the content is accurate.
What a balance sheet contains is, after all, far more important
than its form. The problem of content comprises a consideration of
two points: (1) the proper inclusion of all items, both assets and
liabilities, belonging in the balance sheet; and (2) the correct
valuation of the items so included.</p>

<p>With regard to the first, it may be said briefly that care must be
exercised to see that all assets belonging to the business and having
value, and that all claims against the business of whatever nature, are
included.</p>

<p>Assuming that a given balance sheet contains a list of <i>all</i> the
assets and <i>all</i> the liabilities, the further problem of the
proper valuation of these items must be considered. A balance sheet
in which the title Cash includes counterfeit bills, N. G. (that is,
uncollectible) checks and other similar items, would not be considered
a reliable balance sheet. Similarly, the basis for the valuation of
each of the asset items must be investigated and determined correct
before the balance sheet may be considered to represent the true
financial condition of the business. It is the experience of every
business that it cannot collect all of the credits extended to
customers. Regardless of how carefully credit is granted, it will be
found that some customers do not pay their debts. Accounts and notes
receivable must, accordingly, be valued with a proper consideration
for the estimated amount of the uncollectible portion. The stock of
merchandise on hand must be valued according to the standard formula,
at cost or market, whichever is the lower. The deferred charges group
of assets will show the value of the unconsumed portions of the assets
purchased, with due regard to the time element. Thus, a three-year
insurance policy purchased at the beginning of the year will at the
close of the year be valued at two-thirds of its original cost. The
fixed asset group will be valued at cost less depreciation, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
represents the amount of the loss in value of the assets due to wear
and tear, lapse of time, and obsolescence.</p>

<p>In determining liabilities, providing they have all been included,
there is not the danger of an understatement, because their amount is
subject to verification on the basis of the creditors’ claims. For
obvious reasons the liabilities are seldom overstated.</p>

<p><b>General Principles Governing Form and Content.</b>—In drawing up
a balance sheet, the form must be flexible enough to meet whatever
requirements for information may be placed upon it. Thus, a balance
sheet to be presented to the banker as the basis of a loan should be
carefully classified so as to show clearly the financial condition,
and sufficient detail should be given to indicate the basis used in
valuing the various items. A balance sheet drawn up for publication
may, on the other hand, contain less detailed information and less
attention need be given to its form. A balance sheet drawn up for use
within the business itself may well contain very full information
and its form should be such as will accurately portray the status of
affairs. A balance sheet which shows on its face that cognizance is
taken of uncollectible accounts and of the loss in fixed assets due
to depreciation, is much more valuable as a financial statement than
one lacking that information, provided of course it is to be used to
indicate that consideration has been taken of those elements. Excepting
for the general remark that regard must always be had to the purpose
for which the balance sheet is drawn up, no hard-and-fast rule can be
laid down in the matter of the relative fullness of detail with which
it should be made.</p>

discussed in this chapter, the following statement showing the

<span class="h_subtitle">THE COMPARATIVE BALANCE SHEET</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Comparison of Net Worths.</b>—The aim of every business enterprise
is to increase its net worth. If James Runyon at the beginning of the
year is worth $5,000 and at its close $7,500, it is evident that he has
increased his wealth by $2,500. Very little information is given him or
anyone else as to the manner in which the increase took place, except
that it came about in the ordinary course of business. No criterion is
given by which to compare effort with result. An increase of $2,500 may
or may not be commensurate with the labor expended in effecting it.
However, since a business is not likely to remain stationary, there is
a degree of satisfaction in knowing merely the extent of the change in
its net worth. The taking of an inventory, the appraising of the value
of the assets from time to time, and the setting of the liabilities
for the same dates over against them, is the method of determining
the corresponding net worths. A comparison of these net worths shows
their increase or decrease during the period. A further analysis of
the individual items may be made. A comparison of each asset at the
beginning of the period with its value at the end of the period, shows
the increase or decrease in that item. A similar comparison of each
liability item brings out the increase or decrease during the period.</p>

<p><b>How a Gain or Loss May Be Evidenced.</b>—During a period a gain or
increase in net worth may come about in one of four ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The assets may remain the same and the
liabilities may decrease.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">2. The liabilities may remain the same and the
assets may increase.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">3. The assets may decrease but the liabilities
suffer a greater decrease.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">4. The assets may increase but the liabilities
undergo a smaller increase.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Provided no more money has been invested in the business, and none has
been withdrawn, there has been in all the above instances an increase
in net worth, that is, a profit has resulted. If the reverse of the
above relationships obtains, there has been a decrease in net worth,
or a loss.</p>

<p>The following statements illustrate the points discussed above.</p>

<p>The various types of information essential to judging the financial
condition as disclosed by the above balance sheets will now be
discussed.</p>

<p><b>Comparison of Balance Sheets.</b>—A comparison of balance sheets
gives more information than merely the amount of profit for the year.
It indicates trends in the business. Thus a comparison of the notes
and accounts receivable for the two years may give some indication
of the vigor with which collections are pressed. If the volume of
business done, that is, the amount of sales made, was about the same
during the two years, and if there are more uncollected accounts at
the close of the second year than at the close of the first, it would
tend to show that collections were less satisfactory during the second
year. Investigation may show that this is due to general conditions
of business in the country rather than to failure to push collections
vigorously. If there is any marked change in the amount of the stock
of merchandise on hand it would invite inquiry. If the stock is much
larger at the end of the second year than at the end of the first, it
might indicate that the business man is speculating in merchandise,
that he considers the buyer’s market during the year particularly
favorable and has laid in an abnormally large stock. A banker with
large experience in similar businesses can formulate a fairly accurate
judgment of how much working capital a concern should have invested in
merchandise. With that as a criterion he can tell the normal amount of
merchandise the business should carry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>A comparison of current liabilities for the two periods will indicate
the extent to which borrowed working capital is being used. Thus,
an unusual increase in stock-in-trade may be offset by an equally
large increase in current liabilities, and so would indicate that the
merchant has done his buying on credit or has used borrowed working
capital to increase his stock. The danger of this is apparent in a
fluctuating merchandise market, particularly if the swing is generally
downward. A comparison of the working capital for the two periods gives
useful information. A decrease in the amount of working capital may
indicate an investment of it in fixed plant which, if continued, will
lead to trouble with current creditors. An increase in working capital
may point to the advisability of greater sales effort.</p>

<p>A comparison of fixed assets for the two periods will show the
increase or decrease in the plant investment. If this has been offset
by a corresponding increase or decrease in fixed liabilities, no
additional capital of the owners has become tied up in fixed plant,
while the reverse is true if there is not that correspondence between
fixed assets and fixed liabilities. Where the ratio between current
liabilities and fixed liabilities has increased, it may point to
the desirability of funding some of the current debt. Short-term
liabilities have apparently been incurred for the purpose of extending
the fixed plant. It is usually desirable to convert, that is, fund
these current liabilities into long-term liabilities in order to
conserve working capital to pay current debts.</p>

<p>Thus it is seen that a proper understanding of the items in the two
balance sheets and of their various interrelationships will oftentimes
give very valuable information. Banks and business houses which
are called upon to extend credit, maintain regular files of credit
information, including periodic balance sheets, concerning their
present and prospective customers, so that they can judge fairly
accurately the condition of the businesses.</p>

<p><b>The Comparative Balance Sheet—Its Content and Form.</b>—A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
comparison of the above balance sheets shows an increase of net
worth of $2,354.25 during the year. It shows also that this profit
is accounted for by an increase of $2,932.50 in the assets, which is
offset by an increase of $578.25 in the liabilities, leaving a net
increase of $2,354.25.</p>

<p>The two statements thus separated do not lend themselves easily to a
comparison of individual items. Accordingly, a method of showing the
comparison known as the “Comparative Balance Sheet” form is used. This
brings all the data into juxtaposition and so makes comparison easy.
The balance sheet for the current year is shown first, followed by
that for the preceding year. The increase and decrease column uses the
current year as a basis for comparison with the preceding year.</p>

While it is true that a great deal of valuable information can be
secured from a comparative balance sheet, and that this form of balance
sheet locates definitely the changes in the asset and liability items,
summarizes those changes, and shows the net profit, it nevertheless
fails to disclose the forces within the business organization which
have brought about the changes—it sets forth effect or result but not
cause. A supplementary or rather a complementary statement is needed to
show the reasons for the changes. This is discussed in the following
two chapters.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span class="h_subtitle">THE ECONOMIC OR PROFIT AND LOSS<br /> ELEMENTS OF A BUSINESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Fuller Information Needed.</b>—As indicated in <a href="#Page_32">Chapter IV</a>,
in the summarization of the business transacted during a given period,
it is not usually sufficient to know how much net worth has changed;
nor is the whole story told when it is known exactly what items are
responsible for the change, that is, which of the properties are worth
more and which are worth less at the end than at the beginning of the
period. Additional information is necessary to account for the changes
shown by the comparative balance sheet.</p>

<p>The proprietor who knows simply that his cash is $1,000 less now than
it was at the corresponding time in the last fiscal period, has not
the kind of control over his business that his competitor has who
knows that the $1,000 was expended for an increased stock of goods, or
that an outstanding liability of that amount has been settled, or that
his expenses for the period have been larger by $1,000 than for the
former period. His competitor may be worse off but he at least has the
advantage of knowing the reason for his being so. He has made a correct
diagnosis of the pulse beat of his business. If he cannot heal its ills
or secure aid for it, he can at least have the satisfaction of giving
it a respectable burial, and the autopsy will then disclose that he
failed to take advantage of his information until it was too late.</p>

<p>However, the point should be clearly held in mind that the proprietor
who knows exactly what is happening in his business is in a position
to exercise a definite and sure control over it. Hence, the accounting
department, to justify its existence, should aim to give full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
information as to what is taking place within the business and what
eventually will be the result in its financial life. Only in this way
can the department serve as a means of control.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Records.</b>—A business must have assets and usually
must incur liabilities; a plant must be used, stock-in-trade must be
bought, and sold, and usually sufficient capital must be provided for
the extension of credit to customers. Capital for the payment of the
operating expenses of the business, the maintenance of the plant, the
payment of salaries and wages of employees, and so forth must at all
times be provided. While it is true that the balance sheet shows the
financial condition of the business, it gives little information as to
the volume of business operations. It indicates the net worth and may
even indicate the increase or decrease in net worth if the comparative
balance sheet is used. Yet as to how that increase or decrease in net
worth came about, little or no information is given. The balance sheet,
in other words, is static; it indicates a quiescent state. It is a
snapshot, showing the wheels of business momentarily stopped.</p>

<p>To give a full survey of the operations during a given period, a motion
picture of the events between the dates of the balance sheets must be
shown. Such a picture is dynamic. It gives a realization of the whirl
and bustle of business being carried on. It pictures volume, content,
and extent, whereas the balance sheet indicates the state arrived at
as of a given moment. For purposes of management, which must control
all the phases of business activity, a balance sheet is insufficient.
A review of the factors producing results up to a given time must
be had. Accordingly, the accounting department must supply not only
information as to the present state of the assets and liabilities,
but also information which indicates how the changes in assets and
liabilities since the last fiscal period were brought about—what
volume of transactions occurred, what expenditures of assets and energy
were necessary to accomplish the results attained. This information,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
for purposes of internal management, is more vital than that
concerning simply the present status of assets and liabilities. It is
complementary to that obtained by a comparison of net worths and it is
therefore explanatory of the changes in net worth.</p>

<p><b>The Net Worth Section Expanded.</b>—In its operation of buying
and selling goods, a business executes many different types of
transactions. As was indicated in <a href="#Page_1">Chapter I</a>,
in the development of the proprietorship equation, some types of
transactions have no effect on proprietorship, that is, they involve
neither a profit nor a loss; while other types of transaction—the
really vital types, because it is for these that the business is
carried on—involve a change in proprietorship, either increasing
or decreasing it. Goods are bought for one price and sold at a
price sufficiently higher to pay for all the expenses of operating
the business and leave a reasonable margin of profit. For example,
goods may be bought for $1,000 and sold for $1,800, bringing about
an increase of $800 in the sum total of the assets. This $800 may
represent temporarily an increase in proprietorship but the increase
must be used first to meet the expenses of operating the business
during the period in which the sale is made, after which the net
result represents the real or permanent increase in proprietorship.
The temporary increase of $800 is offset by a temporary decrease of,
say, $600 for operating expenses. It is vital to business management to
have information not only concerning the net increase in proprietorship
but also concerning these temporary increases and decreases. To give

<p class="space-above1">In the net worth section of this balance sheet, the capital
with which the owner started operations for the year is given first. To this is
appended a summary of the operations for the year resulting in a net
increase in proprietorship which, added to the beginning capital, gives
the capital in the business at the end of the year. This method of
setting up the information concerning the operations of the business
is not used to any extent because the information is of such vital
importance that it deserves more display. Accordingly, a separate
statement, known as the “Statement of Profit and Loss,” or “Statement
of Business Operations,” is drawn up to explain the balance sheet net
worth item, Net Increase in Proprietorship for the year, which shows
just the amount of the net profit. The detail of this item is given in
this complementary statement. The above illustration is given merely
for the purpose of pointing out the relationship between the statement
of operations and the balance sheet. From this it will be seen that the
statement of profit and loss is really a part of the net worth section
of the balance sheet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temporary Proprietorship Records.</span>—The proprietorship
records, indicating as they do the sources of changes in net worth, are kept day
by day as transactions take place, are summarized at the close of the
period, and the net result is determined. They are called temporary
because, as is seen, they do not at the time of record have regard for
the final change in proprietorship. At the end of the regular periods,
to determine the total or final change, the temporary proprietorship
records are closed or transferred to the summarized record called the
“Profit and Loss Summary.”</p>

<p>Referring to the case of Aaron Conners discussed in <a href="#Page_32">Chapter IV</a>,
assume that the accounting department furnishes the following additional
information from its records:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>During the year from July 1, 1921 to June 30, 1922, Conners bought
$22,362.50 worth of goods; his sales amounted to $28,465.20; he paid
for help $3,050.50; his other expenses were $2,405.45; and he estimated
the wear and tear on furniture at 10%, or $52.50. As shown in his
statement for 1922, he had $10,260 worth of merchandise on hand on June
30, 1922.</p>

<p>The analysis of this information explains the changes in his net
worth during the year. The goods he started with plus those purchased
during the year are the total goods to be accounted for, which
amounted to $30,862.50 ($8,500 + $22,362.50 = $30,862.50). These
goods were accounted for by his sales during the year and the amount
on hand. Knowing how much was on hand June 30, 1922, viz., $10,260,
he determined that the goods sold must have been the difference or
$20,602.50 ($30,862.50 - $10,260 = $20,602.50). The price which he
received for these goods sold was $28,465.20; hence, his profits from
sales were $7,862.70, the difference between selling price and cost.</p>

<p>We find, also, that the expenses he incurred in selling his goods
and conducting his business generally were $3,050.50 for clerk hire,
office help, delivery boys, etc.; and other expenses, such as rent,
taxes, repairs, delivery upkeep, supplies, heat, light, and the like,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
amounted to $2,405.45. He estimated that his store fixtures depreciated
in value $52.50. All these items, representing costs of doing business,
amounted to $5,508.45 ($3,050.50 + $2,405.45 + $52.50 = $5,508.45),
which subtracted from his profits from sales, $7,862.70, gives him a
net gain of $2,354.25 ($7,862.70 - $5,508.45 = $2,354.25). This gain
tallies with the increased proprietorship of that amount shown by the
balance sheet of June 30, 1922.</p>

<p>The technical form of the summary of the temporary proprietorship
elements will be presented in the next chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE PROFIT AND LOSS SUMMARY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Type of Information Needed.</b>—The need and purpose of the
information to be furnished by the temporary proprietorship records
was pointed out in <a href="#Page_38">Chapter V</a>. Without information of
this sort, proper control of business operations cannot be exercised. These
records supply a summarized picture of the activities of the business
during a definite period, which have as their goal the increase in
proprietorship—the making of a profit. In attaining this goal, two
main types of activities or operations are entered into, usually
classified under the heads of: (1) income or earnings, by which
is meant those activities which immediately and directly increase
proprietorship; and (2) expenses or outgo, comprising those activities
which decrease proprietorship. Expenses are the costs incurred in
securing income, and are therefore deductions from it. A fuller
explanation of these terms will now be given.</p>

<p><b>Income.</b>—Income is usually of two types: operating and
non-operating. These terms are always relative; that is, what is an
operating income in one business may be a non-operating income in
another business. The term “operating income” is used to indicate the
main sources of income in a given business. It is always the duty of
the accounting department to indicate the sources of income. Thus in a
trading or mercantile business, the selling of goods to customers is
the main source of income. In a professional business, the selling of
services, often titled “professional fees,” is the main source; in a
brokerage or commission business, commissions earned; in institutions,
tuition and other fees; in a financial business, interest earnings; in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
a society, membership fees. These are typical titles for indicating the
main source of income in the several kinds of undertakings mentioned.</p>

<p>While sales are the major source of income in a trading concern,
there may be supplementary sources. It may own stocks and bonds from
which income may be derived. In a manufacturing or mining enterprise
the company may own dwelling houses and rent them to its employees.
Conditions of travel and communication may also force it to provide
stores, places of amusement, and so forth for its workers. From all
these supplementary activities it will derive income. As it was not
organized primarily for these purposes, but chiefly to manufacture,
or mine a commodity, the income from these collateral activities is
classed as non-operating income.</p>

<p>The distinction, then, between operating and non-operating income is,
as mentioned above, always a relative one and will be determined in
any given instance on the basis of major activities and supplementary
or minor activities. Some of the titles under which income is recorded
will now be explained:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sales.</span> Under this title is recorded
the amount of sales of the stock-in-trade in a merchandising or
manufacturing concern. The two elements included here, namely,
the decrease of the asset merchandise and the increase of
proprietorship—the true income element—will be discussed later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sales Returns.</span> This title does not
represent income but, as its name indicates, shows the amount of the
goods sold which have been returned because of dissatisfaction with the
quality or condition of the goods or some error in sending the wrong
kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sales Allowances.</span> These are similar
to sales returns in that they indicate a deduction from the sales
income for the allowances made to the purchasers who for one reason or
another have just cause to be dissatisfied with the goods but agree to
retain them providing an allowance from the original selling price is made.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interest Income.</span> Under this title is
recorded the income from money loaned or credit extended. Notes
receivable and bonds are the usual sources. Sometimes open accounts
receivable also bring interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rental Income.</span> Under this title is
recorded income received from the lease of premises, lands, or
buildings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professional Fees.</span> Under this title is
recorded the income from charges made for professional services.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Commissions Earned.</span> Included under this
title is the income received from services rendered in the selling of
commodities for a principal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purchase Discount.</span> This represents the
deduction allowed from the original charge for paying a debt in advance
of the date named in the purchase contract.</p>

<p><b>Expenses.</b>—Expenses are also of two types: operating and
non-operating. The same distinction is made here as with income. Those
expenses incurred in securing operating income are operating expenses,
while those incurred in securing non-operating income or for other
purposes are called non-operating expenses.</p>

<p>To secure control over the operating and non-operating types of
activities, it is necessary to compare operating income with operating
expenses, and non-operating income with non-operating expenses, in
order to measure the return by the effort expended in securing that
return. Some of the more common titles under which the record of
expenses is made are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salaries (Wages).</span> Under this title is
included the cost of the services rendered by employees. This may be
classified in accordance with the department in which the service is
rendered; for example, factory wages, salesmen’s salaries, office
salaries, and so forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Traveling Expenses.</span> The costs of railroad
fare, entertainment, and so forth, when traveling in the interests of
the business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Advertising.</span> The cost of publicity in
making known the commodities offered for sale by the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buying Expense.</span> The costs incurred in
making purchases for the business. These may comprise the salaries of
buyers and all expenses in connection with maintaining a purchasing
department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rent.</span> The cost for the use of premises
not owned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plant Maintenance.</span> The cost of upkeep,
repairs, and so forth, on the plant used by the business. The cost, by
purchase or manufacture, of light, heat, and power is included here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Depreciation.</span> The decrease in value of a
fixed asset due to wear and tear, lapse of time, obsolescence, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bad Debts.</span> The amount of outstanding
accounts receivable which have proven or are judged to be
uncollectible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sales Discounts.</span> The cost incurred
because of the financial policy of charging a customer a smaller amount
than the amount of the bill, provided he pays by a given date.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Telephone, Telegraph, Stationery, Postage,
Interest Cost, Commissions Paid, and so forth.</span> These all
indicate by their titles the nature of the expense or cost items.</p>

<p>The student should understand that expenses may be set up in very
much greater detail than that indicated by the above titles. Usually
the title under which record of an expense is made will indicate with
sufficient clearness its character.</p>

<p><b>The Profit and Loss Summary.</b>—As indicated in <a href="#Page_38">Chapter V</a>,
the profit and loss summary shows the manner in which the net worth of the
business has been changed as the result of operations of the business,
as distinguished from changes brought about through withdrawal or
investment of capital. Although it is really a part of the balance
sheet, which shows financial condition, because of its importance it
is, however, set up as a separate statement. It amplifies and fills out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the record shown by the balance sheet. It is a supplementary record
because it gives additional information, and is complementary to the
balance sheet because it rounds out and completes the story of business
life there recorded.</p>

<p>Just as with the balance sheet, the main problems of the profit and
loss summary relate to: (1) its form; and (2) its content. After an
explanation of some of the terms used in connection with the summary,
these two problems will be discussed.</p>

<p><b>The Fiscal Period.</b>—Because of the work involved and the
frequent incompleteness of the records at the close of each day, a
daily statement of condition is very seldom made up. The business
experience of a particular enterprise determines the frequency of
preparation of these statements. Whatever the period may be between
statements, be it a month, three months, a half-year, or a year, it is
called the fiscal period, i.e., it is the period at the end of which
records are summarized for the purpose of ascertaining the profit or
loss for the period. For purposes of comparison with preceding and
following fiscal periods, under similar conditions, the fiscal period
should be, and usually is a period of regular length—a half-year or
year being perhaps the most common, though in many enterprises it is
customary to draw up supplementary monthly statements.</p>

<p><b>Need for the Physical Inventory.</b>—Again, because of the work
involved, especially where the product dealt in is small in value and
sales are numerous—as in stores dealing in clothing, food, and the
like—no record of the cost of each article is kept as it is sold,
only the sale price being recorded. It is not possible, therefore, to
determine from the records as usually kept, the cost of the goods on
hand at a given time. The records are kept in this way, not because
systems of accounting cannot be devised to make both records, but
because the results obtained by such systems are not justified by their
cost when other and less expensive means can be used with almost as
satisfactory results.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The customary method of finding the cost of goods sold was indicated
in <a href="#Page_38">Chapter V</a>. Summarized, it requires that from
the sum of goods on hand at the beginning and those purchased since,
there be subtracted the goods on hand and unsold at the close of the
period. This last item, the goods on hand and unsold, is secured by
making an actual count and valuation of such goods at the close of the
fiscal period. The expedient of physical inventory-taking is therefore
brought in as an aid to the accounting records, but only in the
interests of economy.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>Form of Profit and Loss Summary</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Principles Governing Make-Up.</span> The
profit and loss statement, as the complement of the balance sheet, is
just as formal in character and the same general considerations govern
as the make-up of the balance sheet, viz.: (1) the general purpose it
is to serve; (2) the likelihood of obscuring essential facts through
too great detail; and (3) the general appearance is to legibility,
clearness of form and expression, and arrangement on the page.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Title.</span> The heading of the summary
must show the name of the business, followed by the title of the
summary and the statement of the exact period covered by it. It was
noted in <a href="#Page_38">Chapter V</a> that whereas the balance sheet
is a statement of financial condition as at a given date, the profit
and loss summary is a statement of operations which have taken place
during a given period. Hence, it is not sufficient merely to state the
date of the close of the period. If, as is usually the case, the fiscal
periods are of uniform length in a given business, the phraseology “For
the Period Ending ...” will be sufficient for use within that business.
It is better, however, for all statements of operation to indicate the
length of the period covered. A typical heading for the profit and loss
summary is indicated below:</p>

<p class="f120 no-wrap"><span class="smcap">James R. Robinson &amp; Company<br />
Statement of Profit and Loss For the Six Months’ Period Ending December 31, 19—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
<span class="smcap">Arrangement.</span> The arrangement of the
summary has already been indicated. The income from operations, that
is, the operating income, is shown firsthand, and is followed by the
operating expense, and then by the amount of the difference or the net
result of operation. Next is shown the non-operating income, followed
by the non-operating expense. The net result of this combined with
the net result from operations gives the net result for the period,
which is the figure shown on the balance sheet, the detail of which is
explained by the profit and loss summary.</p>

<p><b>Content of Profit and Loss Summary.</b>—The content of the profit
and loss summary is determined by the need of information for purposes
of management. A profit and loss summary which is sufficient for a
small business, where the proprietor is in intimate contact with all
phases of the business, would not give sufficient information for the
proper control of a large business, where the managing executives are
dependent for their information as to the various phases of business
activity on reports made to them. There is, however, a fairly standard
outline or skeleton in accordance with which this summary is usually
drawn up. It is the purpose here to explain that outline.</p>

<p>The first section of the statement has for its purpose the separation
of the sales item into its two elements, referred to above: (1) the
Cost of Goods Sold, which indicates the amount by which the asset
merchandise has been decreased through sale of goods; and (2) the Gross
Profit or the excess of selling price ever cost, out of which must
be met the costs of operating the business before the net change in
proprietorship can be determined. This section is usually spoken of
as the “trading” section of the statement. The set-up of this section
shows, accordingly: (1) the Sales item, from which is shown deducted
the amounts of sales returns and sales rebates and allowances in order
to arrive at the figure of net sales; and (2) the Cost of Goods Sold,
under which is listed the cost of goods sold as explained in <a href="#Page_38">Chapter V</a>.
This cost requires the showing of the initial inventory, the purchases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
for the period, the inward costs of laying down the merchandise at the
place of business, such as insurance on goods in transit, freight and
cartage costs, and so forth. From the sum of these items will be shown
deducted the returned purchases and the amount of the final inventory,
the difference indicating the cost price of goods disposed of by sale.
With the “inward” cost of goods is sometimes included the sum total
of all buying expenses. In other cases, particularly where a complete
purchasing department is maintained, a separate buying expense section
is set up to summarize these costs.</p>

<p>Following this trading section comes the formal statement of operating
expenses which are usually classified for purposes of information into
the groups: Selling Expenses, General Administrative Expenses, and
Financial Management Expenses. Under each one of these groups should be
listed the detailed items. Thus, under the selling expense group should
be shown such items as salaries to salesmen; the traveling expenses
incurred by them; the cost of publicity, advertising, and so forth; the
sales management expense; and the delivery expenses, although these
expenses are sometimes set up in a group by themselves.</p>

<p>The student will note that under the head of selling expenses are
grouped all of the direct costs incurred in making sales.</p>

<p>Under the general administrative expenses should be shown such items
as office salaries, stationery and supplies, postage, telephone and
telegraph, light, heat, insurance, depreciation, and all other items
which cannot be charged to definite departments of the business but
must be borne by the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Under financial management expense should be listed the various items
of expense which represent the financial activity of the business as
related to its major purposes and which are operating financial expense
items. Here will be shown such items as interest on money borrowed for
operating the business; sales discounts granted customers in order to
secure cash payments from them at an earlier date than the limit of the
normal credit period allowed them; collection costs, and so forth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>A final section of the <i>operating</i> portion of the profit and loss
statement lists the items of income arising out of the management
of the working capital finances of the business. Interest received
on customers’ notes and on cash balances in the bank, and purchase
discounts, are usually the only items of income under this head.</p>

<p>The difference between gross profit on sales and the sum of these
operating expenses minus the financial income, is the operating profit
of the business, sometimes called Net Operating Profit.</p>

<p>The section following this is devoted to the marshaling of the items
of Non-operating Income and Expense. Whichever of these two groups is
the larger is set up first, and from its total is deducted the total of
the other group. The net amount is then shown extended under the item
of net operating profit, to which it is added if it is a net income
item and from which it is subtracted if it is a net expense item. The
resulting figure is the Net Profit for the period.</p>

<p>Occasionally there are extraordinary items of profit or loss not to
be classified under any of the above heads, which have to be shown in
additional sections of the profit and loss statement. These are matters
which will be taken up later.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the above paragraphs outline a simple
statement of profit and loss for a commercial or trading business as
distinguished from an industrial or manufacturing enterprise, the
statement for which is somewhat more complex even in its general
outlines.</p>

<p><b>Algebraic Content of the Profit and Loss Statement.</b>—An
algebraic presentation of the profit and loss statement is oftentimes
valuable. The cost-of-goods-sold portion becomes:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub1">(1) Initial Inventory + Purchases</li>
<li class="isub8">  - Final Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold</li>
<li class="isub0">(2)  Sales - Cost of Goods Sold = Gross Trading Profit</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the statement is covered by the following equation:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub1">(3) Gross Trading Profit</li>
<li class="isub6">- (Selling Expenses</li>
<li class="isub6">+ General Administrative Expenses</li>
<li class="isub6">+ Financial Management Expense</li>
<li class="isub6">- Financial Management Income)</li>
<li class="isub6">± (Non-operating Income - Non-operating Expense)</li>
<li class="isub1"> </li>
<li class="isub6">= Net Profit</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Disposition of the Net Profit.</b>—The net profit for the
period belongs to the proprietor and constitutes an increase in his
proprietorship or investment, unless he has already drawn out some
of these profits as they accrued. In this case, his drawings must be
subtracted from the net profit indicated before showing the increment
to his net worth. Accordingly, a final section of the profit and
loss statement may give the disposition of the net profit and its
appropriation or addition to the previous net worth or proprietorship
item. This section, when used, is known as the appropriation section.
If the business is a partnership, this section should show in detail
the distribution of net profit among the several partners according to
the agreement among them as to the proportions in which they are to
share gains or losses. If a corporation, it should give the disposition
made of the net profit in the way of dividends to the stockholders, and
any other appropriation made of these profits, including transfer to
surplus.</p>

<p>Two illustrations—one very simple, the other more complex—typical of
profit and loss summaries are given for the guidance of the student.</p>

<p><b>The Two Methods of Determining Net Profit.</b>—It is particularly
important to note that the profit shown by the profit and loss
statement must be the same as that developed by the comparative balance
sheet, since both cover the same period and constitute merely two
ways of developing the same result. For this reason they are valuable
in proving the correctness of results, acting as checks against each
other. The student must bear in mind, however, that the increase or
decrease in net worth as shown by the comparative balance sheet must
always be adjusted by taking account of additional investments or
withdrawals of capital before the net profit for the period can be
determined, and therefore before this figure can be used as a check
against the amount of net profit shown by the statement of profit and
loss.</p>

<p>The accounting department keeps both classes of records, viz., the
asset and liability records and the temporary proprietorship or income
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and expense records, not because both are needed to develop the amount
of net profit—either class would do this—but because both are needed
for the additional information which they give and which is valuable
and necessary for the intelligent management of the business.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC AND<br />
THE FINANCIAL ELEMENTS OF A BUSINESS,<br />AND SOME INTER-RATIOS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Various Aspects of the Temporary Proprietorship Records.</b>—The
profit and loss statement has been explained as a summary of the
temporary proprietorship records kept for the purpose of registering
the changes in net worth as they occur from day-to-day, and also for
the purpose of noting the source or cause of many of the changes in
assets and liabilities. The temporary proprietorship records may be
regarded as the chronicle or history of the economic life of the
business. The efforts of the business to produce income with the least
possible outgo in the form of costs or expenses, may be viewed as the
work of forces or agencies striving towards that end. Every effort
is offset by the cost of that endeavor, and unless the result of the
effort be more than its cost, its aim, viz., the increase of net worth,
is not accomplished.</p>

<p><b>Relation between Profit and Loss and Financial Elements.</b>—These
income-producing efforts are the agencies that bring about the changes
in the values of assets and liabilities. Expenses and costs are
incurred for the purpose of securing income. Every expense or cost that
is settled causes a diminution of business assets, usually of the asset
cash. If not settled, it causes an increase in the liabilities, usually
the accounts payable, for the business becomes bound by or liable for
it. Both of these conditions result in a decrease in the net worth.</p>

<p>On the other hand, every item of income, as when a sale of goods is
made, is reflected in an increase of assets or a decrease of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
liabilities. The result of every sale is usually an increase in the
cash or in the claims against persons, the accounts receivable. The
sale may sometimes result in a lessening of liabilities through a
cancellation of the claims of creditors by means of the claims against
customers arising out of the sale. This would be true when goods are
bought from, and sold to, the same person. Thus there is constantly
a direct interrelation between the financial and the profit and loss
elements of every business.</p>

<p><b>Exchanges within the Asset and Liability Groups.</b>—All changes in
individual assets and liabilities, however, are not always the result
of business or economic forces. There may be an even exchange of one
asset for another asset, as when delivery equipment is purchased for
cash. The asset Delivery Equipment is increased by the same amount
as the asset Cash is diminished. Or if a bill of goods is purchased
on credit, an increase of assets is exactly offset by an increase in
liabilities. These changes are illustrated in the second example in
<a href="#Page_1">Chapter I</a>, showing Runyon’s proprietorship.</p>

<p>It is seen, therefore, that the changes in individual assets and
liabilities are not so certain an index of changes in proprietorship
as those registered by the temporary proprietorship records. The vital
history of a business is its profit and loss record, the story of
its economic life. As a means of control this is of first importance
because it chronicles the causes of most changes in financial
condition. The statement of financial condition may be looked upon as
a picture of the framework, the skeleton of the business personality,
upon which is superimposed its economic structure. When both the
financial framework and the profit and loss summary are given, it is
possible with reasonable accuracy to tell the whole history of the
business activities for the period covered.</p>

<p><b>Confusion between Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet Items.</b>—The
beginner frequently has trouble in making a proper classification of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
income items and sometimes of expense items. Take Interest Income as an
example. The asset Cash Received is confused with the title Interest
Income, which denotes the source of the cash received. The accounting
department maintains both types of records. The receipt of cash arising
out of interest income would be classified and recorded under two
heads: (1) the asset Cash, to indicate the increase in that asset; and
(2) the temporary proprietorship record Interest Income, to give the
profit and loss information necessary for purposes of management.</p>

<p>Similarly, the beginner oftentimes confuses the sales income record
with the cash record of a cash sale transaction. Also, when cash
is disbursed for expense purposes, the decrease in the asset is
often confused with the expense record. When an expense is incurred
it brings about either a decrease in assets, usually cash if the
transaction is settled at once; or an increase in liabilities, usually
an accrued expense item if the transaction is not immediately settled.
Accordingly, in making the record the accounting department must
show the decrease in the asset or the increase in the liability in
the balance sheet group of records and the source of that decrease
or increase under some expense title in the profit and loss group of
records. Familiarity with the titles appearing in the profit and loss
statement should prevent this confusion.</p>

<p><b>Illustration.</b>—To show the interactions between the balance
sheet and the profit and loss groups of records, the following
illustration is given. There is shown first a comparative balance
sheet, indicating the condition of a business at the beginning and the
end of a period. This comparative balance sheet, it will be noted,
shows a net profit of $33,250. There is also given a statement of
profit and loss, showing the sources of the income and the expenses of
the business. The statement indicates a net profit of $33,250 for the
period. By starting with the financial condition as indicated by the
balance sheet at the beginning of the period and working into it the
operations for the year as shown by the statement of profit and loss,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and by using the balance sheet at the end of the period as a goal, we
can trace the probable interaction of the two types of records for the
period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interrelation between Cash and Other Balance
Sheet and Profit and Loss Items.</span> If to the amount of cash on
hand at the beginning of the period we add the cash received from
customers, as determined above, and that received from interest income,
as indicated by the profit and loss statement, we arrive at the total
cash available for use during the period.</p>

<p>Cash expenditures have been made for the following purposes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Payments to creditors for merchandise of
$287,000 as above.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Inward freight and cartage $15,000, as shown
by the profit and loss statement.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Sales salaries $19,000. (This amount is
determined by considering the expense of $20,000, as shown by the
profit and loss statement, in conjunction with the unpaid sales
salaries, as shown by the comparative balance sheet. Thus, if to the
unpaid sales salaries amounting to $1,500 at the beginning of the
period, we add the sales salary expense of $20,000 incurred during the
period and from their sum we subtract the amount of unpaid salaries,
$2,500, at the end of the period, we arrive at the amount of $19,000
spent for salaries during the period.)</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. Advertising $30,000.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. Sundry selling expense $10,000.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">6. Office salaries $10,500.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">7. Insurance $3,750. (This amount is also
determined by considering the amount of unexpired insurance as shown by
the comparative balance sheet in conjunction with the cost of insurance
used during the current period, as shown by the profit and loss
statement. It will be noted that $250 worth of insurance was in force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
at the beginning of the period, that $3,000 worth of insurance was used
during the period—hence it must have been necessary to buy additional
insurance amounting to $2,750 during the period. When we find, however,
that there is unexpired insurance at the end of the period amounting to
$1,000, it will be seen that there must have been purchased during the
period $3,750 worth of insurance.)</p>

<p class="neg-indent">8. Sundry office expense $2,000.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">9. Interest cost $10,000.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">10. Plant and equipment $25,000. (It will be
noted from the comparative balance sheet that there has been a net
increase of only $7,500 in plant and equipment. While $25,000 was added
to the plant and equipment asset during the year, there was a decrease
in value due to depreciation, amounting to $17,500, as shown by the
profit and loss statement. This depreciation expense is reflected as
a decrease in the value of the asset Plant and Equipment and does not
therefore decrease the asset Cash.)</p>

<p class="neg-indent">11. Notes payable $5,000—the decrease being shown
by the comparative balance sheet.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">12. Mortgage payable $50,000—also shown on the
comparative balance sheet.</p>
</div>

<p>If from the total cash available for use there is deducted the cash
expended, as indicated above, the difference should indicate the amount
of cash on hand at the close of the period. This balance of $10,000, as
indicated by the tabulated statement below, is the amount shown by the
comparative balance sheet as being on hand.</p>

<p>By a careful study of the interrelations between various items as
explained above, the student will see that the interactions between
all of the transactions for the year as set forth in the comparative
balance sheet and the profit and loss statement, have been indicated
and proved. The proof is secured in the tie-up between the figure of
cash as shown by the cash statement, and that shown in the comparative
balance sheet statement as cash on hand at the end of the period.</p>

<p><b>Inter-Ratios and Their Uses.</b>—Before leaving the study of the
balance sheet and profit and loss statement and their interrelations,
it is desirable to explain certain ratios between items found on both
statements. These are ratios which are watched very carefully in judging
the financial condition of a business. Their significance is apparent.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Merchandise Turnover.</span> By merchandise
turnover is meant the rate at which the merchandise stock is moved or
turned over by sale during the fiscal period. The ratio expressing the
rate of turnover is found by dividing the cost of goods sold, as shown
in the profit and loss statement, by the average inventory carried
for the year. Where there are available only the figures of opening
and closing inventory, the amount of the average inventory is taken
as one-half of the sum of these two inventories. The rate of turnover
varies in different businesses, ranging as high as 15 or 20 in some and
as low as 1 or 2 in others. The value of a rapid turnover is apparent.
One dollar invested in merchandise where the rate of turnover is 10 is
equivalent to $10 invested where the rate is only 1. The more work a
dollar does, the greater the profit possibilities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Working Capital Turnover.</span> The amount
of sales as indicated by the profit and loss statement, divided
by the working capital—the excess of current assets over current
liabilities—as determined from the balance sheet, is called the
“working capital turnover.” This indicates the rate at which the
working capital is used in securing sales. Where the amount of working
capital on hand varies markedly at different periods of the year,
the average should be used as the basis for estimating the rate of
turnover.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Accounts Receivable to Sales.</span> The
fraction represented by dividing the amount of outstanding accounts at
the end of the year by the volume of sales during the year, indicates
the portion of sales which has not yet been collected in cash. If this
fraction is multiplied by the length of the fiscal period, expressed
in months, and the result compared with the normal credit term allowed
customers, it will indicate the trend of collections. For example,
if the outstanding accounts at the close of the period are $150,000,
the sales for the year are $1,200,000, and the normal credit period
is 30 days, it will be seen that by the above ratios the $150,000
of outstanding accounts represents on the average the sales for
approximately 1½ months</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub3">1.  Cost of goods sold to net sales.</li>
<li class="isub3">2.  Gross profit to net sales.</li>

<li class="isub3">5.  Net financial management expenses to net sales.</li>
<li class="isub3">6.  Net profit to net sales.</li>

<p>These ratios, set up each fiscal period and compared with similar
ratios for previous periods, indicate very definitely the trend of
income and expenses and are useful in the determination of business
policies.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE ACCOUNT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Goal of Account-Keeping.</b>—Throughout the preceding
chapters constant reference has been made to records or data of the
business furnished by the accounting department. Knowing the use made
of these data in the compilation of financial and profit and loss
summaries, we shall trace the process of gathering that information
in exactly reverse order; first, through the ledger, where it is
grouped and summarized in accounts and made ready for the preparation
of statements; then into the books of original entry, where the
information is first sorted and classified for posting to the proper
ledger accounts, with a view always to fit it ultimately into the final
statements of financial and business condition; and finally, to the
business papers arising out of the transactions, which are the basis or
first source of all accounting records.</p>

<p><b>The Ledger and Its Content.</b>—The ledger may be defined as the
book of accounts. In it are collected most of the data needed for the
final statements showing the financial condition of the business. By
means of its account titles, it makes an analytical record of all
transactions, according to the information desired, and through the
mechanism of the account it groups and summarizes all data affecting
each particular account, thus furnishing the proprietor with totals
instead of items. In the ledger, therefore, must be kept two main
classes of accounts, viz., those used for making up the balance
sheet and those used for making up the profit and loss statement.
The one group shows assets and liabilities, and the other temporary
proprietorship increases and decreases brought about by the receipt of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
income and the payment of expenses. The ultimate or net proprietorship
is determined by the summarization of all temporary accounts in the way
shown in preceding chapters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ledger Account Defined.</span>—An account
may be defined as a record of one or more items, either similar or
dissimilar, relating to the same person or thing, kept under an
appropriate heading or title. The record is kept in such a way as
to make easy the addition of similar items and the subtraction of
dissimilar items. Accounts are kept both with persons, as the accounts
receivable and payable already mentioned, and with things, such as
land, buildings, machinery, merchandise, cash, and the like. Some asset
accounts and some accounts kept with persons are usually composed of
both similar and dissimilar items. For example, the cash account is
composed of both cash received and cash paid out items; the accounts
receivable record both the items for which the person is in debt to the
business and those which show the cancellation or settlement of the
debt, in part or in full; and the accounts payable record the items
for which the business is in debt to the person and those which show
cancellation of the debt or settlement by the business. Accounts which
record income and expenses usually comprise only similar items, as
where all sales of merchandise are recorded under one head or account
and all purchases under another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Account Title.</span>—The title given to an
account is important. It should indicate clearly the content of the
account. Accuracy is a basic necessity in accounting. Correct titles
are therefore essential. A title which does not clearly and truthfully
indicate the nature of the account, or one which is so chosen that
under it may be recorded items of various and doubtful kinds, gives
prima facie evidence of an imperfect knowledge of accounting principles
or of a desire to hide data which will not bear close scrutiny.
Therefore, care should be exercised in the selection of titles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p><b>The Two Sections of the Account.</b>—To separate similar from
dissimilar items, the account is divided into two sections, a left and
a right section, as we shall call them for the present, which are shown
in the standard form given in <a href="#FORM_1">Form 1</a>.</p>

<p>The account head or title is placed in the center over the division
line. At the extreme left of each section are the date columns—year,
month, and day. Note particularly where the “year” is shown. The space
following is for explanatory matter; the next column, left blank in the
illustration, is a reference column whose use will be explained later;
and the last column in each section is the money column, where the
dollar subsection column is further divided into columns for each digit
of the amount. Care must be exercised to observe such rulings when
writing in the amounts. The account with Cash in the illustration shows
on the left a receipt of $150.25 from J. B. Givens, and on the right,
the payment of $5.50 for stationery. These two items are entirely
dissimilar. Another receipt of $72.69 on January 3 from cash sales is
shown on the same side of the account as the record of the previous
receipt and directly under it. Note that the name of the month is not
repeated.</p>

<p><b>The Mechanism of the Account.</b>—Thus the mechanism of the
account is designed not only to give a brief history of each item
entered therein, but primarily to bring together all items of the
same kind relating to that account, so that they may be summarized.
It should be thoroughly understood that all items on each side of the
account are similar items, though the two sides themselves are of
exactly opposite kinds. Where the account has entries on both sides,
i.e., is composed of dissimilar items, a comparison of the totals of
each group shows the condition of the account. In the Cash account
given, the total of the left side, $222.94, showing receipts, compared
with the total of the right, $5.50, showing disbursements, indicates
that there is $217.44 cash now on hand. It is evident, therefore, that
the account is a mathematical device for holding on one side all items
to be added and on the other all items to be subtracted. Only in this
way can addition and subtraction be performed within the account.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
<b>The Number of Accounts.</b>—The number of accounts to be kept in
the ledger is determined by the minuteness of detail desired for the
guidance of the management of a business. The financial and profit
and loss statements usually lack detail and for this reason the items
appearing thereon are frequently subdivided in the ledger into numerous
accounts.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE ACCOUNT<br />(Continued)</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Balance of the Account.</b>—As stated in <a href="#Page_67">Chapter VIII</a>,
the account is divided into two sections, a left and a right, for the
purpose of separating items relating to the same account which are
dissimilar, and thus affording a comparison between the totals of these
dissimilar groups. An account containing dissimilar items may have the
same total on both sides, in which case it is said to balance, i.e.,
the class of items on one side exactly balances or cancels those on
the opposite side; or one side of the account may be larger than the
other, in which case the amount of the excess is called the “balance”
in the account, or of the account. An account takes its nature or
classification from the larger side, on which the balance appears. The
account balances are shown in summarized form on the balance sheet or
the profit and loss statement.</p>

<p><b>The Account Title Indicative of Its Classification.</b>—The account
title or name should be so plain as easily to indicate its main
classification. The two main classes of accounts are, as stated above,
those relating to assets and liabilities, or property—things owned and
things owed; and those relating to proprietorship—those showing the
increases or decreases in net worth. The title of an account should
clearly indicate whether the account belongs to the asset or liability
class, or to the proprietorship class.</p>

<p>The accounts called Cash, Accounts Receivable, Mortgages Payable,
Accrued Wages, clearly show assets and liabilities; while those
entitled Sales, Rent Income, Wages, Expenses, indicate factors
affecting proprietorship.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p><b>The Meaning of Account Balances.</b>—In the asset accounts the
larger side, and therefore the balance of the account, is normally
on the left, i.e., the balance of Cash, Land, Buildings, Furniture
and Fixtures, Notes Receivable, and the like are normally left-side
balances. It follows, therefore, that all entries showing the
acquisition or increase of assets are made on the left side of their
accounts, and all entries showing the disposal or decrease of assets
are made on the right side of the accounts. Very seldom are the
cancellations listed on the right side in excess of the assets listed
on the left.</p>

<p>In the liability accounts the balance is normally on the right side
because liabilities are subtraction items from the assets and should,
therefore, normally be on the opposite side of the account. Notes
Payable, Accounts Payable, Mortgages Payable, Interest Payable, Rent
Payable, and the like, have normally right-side balances. It follows,
therefore, that all entries showing the assumption of liabilities are
made to the right side of the account, and all entries showing the
cancellation of these liabilities are made on the left side. Rarely are
liability cancellations in excess of the liabilities owed.</p>

<p>As will be explained in <a href="#Page_91">Chapter XII</a>, in the group
of accounts indicating decreases in proprietorship, the balance, or
larger side, is normally on the left; in the group showing increases in
proprietorship the balance is normally on the right. The balances of
the accounts, Wages, Salaries, Rent Expense, and all other expenses,
are normally left-side balances. It follows, therefore, that entries
showing the cost of such expenses to the business are made on the
left side of suitably named expense accounts, and entries showing a
reduction in the expenses are made on the right side. Items for wages,
for example, are shown on the left side of the Wages account, and any
subtractions because of overpayment or for other reasons, are shown on
the right side of the account.</p>

<p>The balances of the accounts Sales, Rent Income, Interest Income, and
other kinds of income, are normally right-side balances. From this it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
follows that entries showing income are made on the right side of a
suitable account, and entries indicating a reduction or subtraction
from the income shown are made on the left side of the account. For
example, income from sales is shown on the right side of the Sales
account, while any reduction of that income, as when goods are returned
by customers, is shown on the left side.</p>

<p>Knowing, therefore, to what main class each account belongs—asset,
liability, expense, or income—one always knows on which side the
balance is normally, and also that the items on the opposite side are
subtraction items. Subtraction can be shown in the account only by thus
separating dissimilar items.</p>

<p><b>Relation of the Account to the Financial Statements.</b>—The
equation of the balance sheet is the equation of the ledger. The
fundamental proprietorship equation is written in two ways:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub0">(1) Assets - Liabilities = Proprietorship</li>
<li class="isub0">(2) Assets = Liabilities + Proprietorship</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">The ledger (that is, the accounts in the ledger)
is constructed in accordance with the second form of the proprietorship
equation. In it are found all the accounts of the business, which are
included under the classes Assets, Liabilities, and Proprietorship.
Under Proprietorship are the subgroups: (a) Net Worth, or capital
at the beginning of the period, and (b) Current Profit or Loss. The
Current Profit or Loss is in turn shown by the two groups of accounts:
(1) Income, and (2) Expense. This classification of the accounts and
their relation to the balance sheet are illustrated graphically in the
chart shown in <a href="#FORM_2">Form 2</a>.</p>

<p>The asset accounts have net left-side balances, as previously
explained. Hence, if all the detailed accounts which record assets are
brought together, the sum total of the left-side balances of these
accounts will represent the total assets of the business. Liability
accounts have right-side balances, as also explained. Therefore, if all
the accounts that record the liabilities of the business are brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
together, the sum total of their right-side balances will represent the
total liabilities of the business. The proprietorship accounts have
right-side and left-side balances. The <i>net total</i> of all the
proprietorship accounts will be a right-side balance, however, and will
show the present net worth of the business.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_2" src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="700" />
  <p class="f120">Form 2. Chart of Accounts</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Accordingly, when one views the accounts in the ledger in
their fundamental groupings—namely, assets, liabilities, and
proprietorship—it is seen that the equation of the balance sheet is
also the equation of the ledger. The account is thus seen to be an
integral part of the balance sheet. It is so arranged, however, as to
sort and handle additions and subtractions and to furnish a net result
for use in the balance sheet.</p>

<p>The asset portion of the proprietorship equation is in the ledger
broken up into the various kinds of assets, record of which is
desirable and necessary for purposes of adequate control of the
business. In keeping the record, all the transactions affecting—that
is, either adding to or subtracting from—a given asset are recorded
in the account kept with that asset. In this way each account brings
about a sorting of the transactions affecting it. It separates these
transactions into two kinds, those which add to and those which
subtract from its value, and by means of its net balance at any given
time it summarizes the numberless transactions which have affected it
during a period and gives a net result showing its present status.</p>

<p>In much the same way the liability item of the proprietorship equation
is broken up in the ledger for purposes of detailed information, into
a large number of individual liability accounts. The sum total of the
balance of these accounts is the liability item of the proprietorship
equation.</p>

<p>The proprietorship section of the equation is a little more complex
when split up, as it is in the ledger. In accordance with the chart
given in <a href="#FORM_2">Form 2</a>, it will be seen that proprietorship is
classified in the two main groups: (1) capital at the beginning of the period,
and (2) changes of capital during the period. It is this latter group of
accounts which, as they are carried in the ledger, have both right-side
and left-side balances. The income accounts, which tend to increase
capital and which, when merged with the capital accounts at the
beginning of the period, add to that capital, have right-side balances.
The accounts which tend to decrease capital, that is, the expense
accounts, because they are subtraction items, have left-side balances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
The net increase (or decrease) in capital for the period is the excess
(or deficit) of the total income accounts over the total expense
accounts. The summarized result therefore of current changes in
capital added to the capital at the beginning of the period, gives the
proprietorship of the business at any given time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a business enterprise the accounts in the ledger
will be an opening balance sheet of the business. Day by day by day as
transactions take place, there will be a constant change in the values
of the assets, liabilities, and the proprietorship account which will
thus express the changing financial condition of the business. Some
assets will be increased while others will be decreased; liabilities
will also change; and with these changes there will be brought about a
change in proprietorship—an increase or a decrease. The ledger must
record these changing values as they take place, so that the condition
of the business can be determined practically at any time.</p>

<p>The ledger is thus seen to contain and comprise the balance sheet
of the business at all times. Certain groupings, summarizations,
and adjustments may be necessary before a balance sheet technically
correct as to form and content can be taken from the ledger, but the
fundamental balance sheet equation is always contained in the ledger.
This is pictured graphically in the chart shown in <a href="#FORM_2">Form 2</a>.
A further consideration of the relationships between assets,
liabilities, and proprietorship leads us to an explanation of the
principles or philosophy of debit and credit, a matter which will be
taken up in the next chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE PHILOSOPHY OF DEBIT AND CREDIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Double-Entry Bookkeeping.</b>—Several systems or methods of keeping
business records have at various times been in use. The method which
at the present time is used by all businesses, excepting those of the
simplest sort, is called “double-entry bookkeeping” and is the method
which is being set forth here. It is based on the proprietorship
equation expressed in the form: Assets = Liabilities + Proprietorship.
It is possible to make a balance sheet if only asset and liability
records are kept, because proprietorship is always the difference
between them. Such a system of record-keeping would fail completely in
giving the information as to the current increases and decreases in
proprietorship and the causes of such changes. As was indicated in an
earlier chapter, such a system would have the disadvantages which the
comparative balance sheet has as a means of managing and controlling a
business enterprise. The information which is given by the profit and
loss records of the business would be entirely lacking.</p>

<p>Double-entry bookkeeping, accordingly, keeps a record not only of
assets and liabilities, but also of proprietorship and its constantly
changing value. The advantages of such a system were discussed when the
need for the information furnished by the profit and loss statement was
pointed out (<a href="#Page_39">see page 39</a>). Not only does
double-entry bookkeeping give this full and complete information, but
it ties this information into a system whose mathematical accuracy and
correctness can be proved. It is an invention or device whose purpose
is definitely to give the desired information and to demonstrate the
mathematical correctness of that information.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>As already stated, the system of double-entry bookkeeping is based on
the proprietorship equation. An equation is an expressed equality. The
ledger kept by double-entry bookkeeping always maintains this equality.
The sum total of the entries on the left side of all the accounts must
equal the sum total of the entries on the right side of the accounts.
The way in which the ledger becomes an expanded or detailed balance
sheet was explained fully in the previous chapter. There it was shown
that the sum of the net balances of all asset accounts, as carried in
the ledger as left-side balances, at all times equals the sum of the
net balances of the liability and the proprietorship accounts carried
in the ledger as right-side balances.</p>

<p>It is evident that, if in place of the net balances of each group of
accounts, the gross left- and right-side totals are substituted, the
equation would still be maintained, inasmuch as the net balance in each
instance is secured by subtracting the same amount, namely, the lesser
total, from both sides of the account.</p>

<p>Under double entry, therefore, the equality of the left side of the
ledger, that is, the total of the left-side amounts of all of the
accounts, is constantly maintained with the right side of the ledger,
that is, the total of the right-side amounts of all the accounts. The
vertical division of the ledger separating an account into its left and
right sides, may with little stretch of the imagination be considered
an equality sign, which thus makes one big equation out of all the
accounts in the ledger. Under double-entry bookkeeping, therefore, the
principles of entry in the ledger are based on no logic or philosophy
other than that which attaches to the fundamental proprietorship
equation of the balance sheet. Double entry is an invention, a device,
and its use requires adherence to the principles of entry necessary to
maintain its equation. What these principles are will now be explained.</p>

<p><b>The Business Transaction Defined.</b>—Reference has constantly been
made to business transactions. It may be well to show the idea at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
bottom of such transactions. We may define a business transaction as
an exchange of values. It may be between persons, as when a sale is
made, or it may be between accounts within the business itself, as
when a transfer is made between accounts, i.e., when an item is taken
from one account and transferred to another for the sake of more
clearly showing its nature. Some authors further analyze transactions
as <i>complete</i> when the bargain is fully consummated between the
parties, as when delivery is made and the money is paid in cash; or
<i>incomplete</i> as where something still remains to be done by
either or both parties to the transaction. In this latter case, claims
or rights of action at law arise to protect the parties until the
transaction is consummated. But, since from the accounting standpoint a
claim or right is one kind of property or asset, there is little need
of this finer analysis.</p>

<p><b>Analyzing the Transaction as to Its Accounting Record.</b>—When a
transaction occurs in a business, it must first be classified before
proper record can be made of it under the account title which groups
transactions of a like nature. Its elements must be analyzed, its
effect on assets and liabilities, or on expenses and income, must
be determined. Has the transaction increased or decreased assets or
liabilities, or has it increased or decreased proprietorship, or
has it resulted in simply a transfer between accounts—these are
the first questions to be determined. The basis of all fundamental
classifications is the effect of the transaction upon the balance
sheet and profit and loss statements. They are the goal towards which
all records look, but the principle which determines the subdivisions
in the main classes of accounts and the titles to be given to the
accounts which are to be carried in the records, is the amount and
kind of information desired by the management throughout the fiscal
period. After the transaction has been properly classified, it is
merely a matter of recording it according to the standards or forms of
good accounting, which is merely a device for abbreviating the work of recording,
i.e., the transaction is translated into correct accounting language.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p><b>The Use of Debit and Credit.</b>—To show the side of the account
affected by a transaction, the words “debit” and “credit” are used,
indicating left and right respectively. The use of these words had its
origin with transactions between persons and the accounts kept with
them. The person owing was charged or debited, while the person to whom
the business owed a debt was credited. Through use the terms have come
to have the meaning stated first above, though still retaining their
original connotation when applied to persons.</p>

<p><b>Fundamental Principle of Debit and Credit.</b>—As stated in
<a href="#Page_38">Chapter V</a>, every transaction is recorded from
two viewpoints, viz., its effect on the assets and liabilities and
its effect on the proprietorship or net worth. Sometimes, however,
the transaction may require merely a transfer entry, i.e., a transfer
of an amount from one account to another without affecting the
fundamental classes, as was shown above when defining the transaction
as an exchange of values. If it is remembered that from long-continued
custom asset accounts are debit accounts, i.e., normally have debit
or left-side balances, and liability accounts are credit accounts;
that expense accounts are debit and income accounts are credit, the
fundamental principles for determining the debit and credit involved in
every transaction become pretty well established in one’s mind.</p>

<p>Starting, therefore, with the original investment, whatever form it may
have, the transaction is reducible to the fundamental equation:</p>

<p class="f110">Assets = Liabilities + Proprietorship</p>

<p class="no-indent">in which “liabilities” may or may not be a “zero”
quantity, depending on the nature of the investment. All transactions
thereafter must be viewed according to their effects on the three terms
of the equation above. We may summarize the effects produced by the
various transactions of the business as:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="3" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">with this qualification: that some transactions
result in transfers only without affecting the totals of any of the
three groups above, as when an asset is transferred from one account to
another for purposes of more accurate classification.</p>

<p><b>The Debit and Credit Schedule.</b>—Bearing in mind the customary
distinction between debit and credit, and the fact that entry of a
transaction is always made from a double viewpoint—that of cause and
effect—every transaction may have its debit and credit determined by
the following schedule:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0"
       summary=" " cellpadding="0" rules="cols" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc bb2" colspan="2"> </td>

<p class="space-above2"><b>Debit and Credit Determination
Illustrated.</b>—Examples illustrating the various classes of
transactions and the manner of determining their debit and credit will
now be given. The student should strive to understand the double point
of view necessary in determining debit and credit. It is perhaps well
to call attention to the fact that the illustrations are entirely
unrelated, i.e., do not constitute a sequence of events in any
business. It should also be kept in mind that transactions are recorded
always from the standpoint of the business whose records are being kept.</p>

<p>1. The purchase of merchandise for cash. The result is an increase
of the asset Merchandise caused by the decrease of the asset Cash.
Accordingly, the debit and credit of the entry for the transaction are
shown by the above schedule under (1) and (a), i.e., debit Merchandise
and credit Cash. The transaction is also an illustration of the
transfer entry, in which there is no increase or decrease of total
assets, liabilities, or proprietorship.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>2. The purchase of merchandise on account. This results in an increase
of assets caused by the increase of liabilities. The schedule above
shows under (1) and (b) a debit to Merchandise and a credit to the
personal account payable, indicated by the name of the creditor.</p>

<p>3. The receipt of cash for services performed, as when a broker
receives the amount of his commission in cash. The result here is an
increase of the asset Cash, caused by the increase of proprietorship,
as the performance of services is the chief source of the broker’s
income. The schedule shows under (1) and (c) a debit to Cash and a
credit to some temporary proprietorship account by name, as Commissions
Earned.</p>

<p>4. The payment of a note payable in cash. This results in a decrease of
the liability, Notes Payable, caused by the decrease of the asset Cash.
Accordingly, debit Notes Payable and credit Cash, (2) and (a).</p>

<p>5. The settlement of a personal account payable by giving a note
payable. The effect here is simply a cancellation of one kind of
liability with another kind; it is a transfer entry. Debit the personal
account payable; credit Notes Payable, (2) and (b).</p>

<p>6. The rendering of a business service to a creditor, thereby canceling
an indebtedness to him; as when a physician renders medical aid to his
creditor from whom he has purchased supplies. The effect is a decrease
in liabilities and an increase in proprietorship. Debit the personal
account payable, by name, and credit some temporary proprietorship
account, by name, as Fees or Services, (2) and (c).</p>

<p>7. A workman is paid his wages in cash. The result is a decrease in
proprietorship and a decrease in the asset Cash. Wages are a cost
of doing business and therefore decrease Proprietorship. They are
a service rendered to the business instead of by it—an expense as
distinguished from an income. Debit the temporary proprietorship
account, Wages, and credit Cash, (3) and (a).</p>

<p>8. The account of a lawyer is credited for the amount of his fee. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
decrease of proprietorship, for the service rendered the business, and
an increase in liabilities. Debit Legal Expense and credit the personal
account payable, (3) and (b).</p>

<p>9. Transfer the net gain shown by the Profit and Loss account to the
Surplus account. The result is a simple transfer, causing a decrease in
proprietorship as shown in the Profit and Loss account and an increase
in proprietorship as shown in the Surplus account. Debit Profit and
Loss and credit Surplus, (3) and (c).</p>

<p>In a similar manner, all transactions may be analyzed and their entry
in the accounts determined.</p>

<p><b>Necessary Equilibrium of Debits and Credits.</b>—Before passing
to more detailed rules for debit and credit, the necessary equality
of debits and credits should again be pointed out. Starting with the
proprietorship equation expressed in this form:</p>

<p class="f120">Assets = Liabilities + Proprietorship,</p>

<p class="no-indent">of which the left side is represented in the
accounts by debits and the right side by credits, the equality of the
debit balances and the credit balances of the accounts in the ledger
is readily seen. If, now, for all succeeding transactions an entry
is made having an equal debit and credit, evidently the equilibrium
of the total debits and credits in the accounts is maintained and
the two sides of the ledger are in agreement. The making of an equal
debit and credit for every entry is fundamental and must be strictly
observed.</p>

<p><b>Student’s Use of Working Rules.</b>—In order to indicate the more
usual types of transactions which affect the asset, liability, and
proprietorship accounts, a set-up of the various groups of accounts
will be given, under which will be shown transactions recorded as
debits and those recorded as credits. Accounts will be shown in the
order in which they appear in the balance sheet. The accounts under
each group will, of course, bear their own individual titles and not
the title of the group. Only such entries as are more frequently met
with will be given. Since in the group accounts given as guides only
those entries appear which affect these group accounts, it is deemed
impracticable to attempt to show the contra, or other side of each
entry arising out of the transactions. However, the student should
always supply mentally the contra of each entry shown in the group
reference account. For the sake of clarity, the personal pronouns “we”
and “us” will be used instead of the impersonal name.</p>

<p><b>Accounts with Cash and Notes Receivable.</b>—Entries to the Cash
and Notes Receivable accounts are comparatively simple and are shown in
the following schedule:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0"
       summary=" " cellpadding="0" rules="cols" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc bb2" colspan="2">(<span class="smcap">Name of Account</span>)</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl br"><i>Debit</i>:</td>
      <td class="tdl"> <i>Credit</i>:</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1 br">(1) For all receipts or incoming items. </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">(a) For all disbursements or outgoing items.</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Transactions with cash are self-explanatory.</p>

<p>The accounts representing transactions with notes require some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
explanation. When, in the course of business, we receive a note, Notes
Receivable is debited and the person who gives it is credited, because
our asset Notes Receivable is increased and the claim against the open
account of the person giving the note is decreased. Similarly, when
that note is disbursed by us, i.e., goes out of our possession, the
asset is diminished and therefore Notes Receivable is credited.</p>

<p>A note receivable can be disposed of in several ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Through its release on payment by the maker,</p>
<p class="neg-indent">2. Through its transfer by us to another person
in settlement of a claim against us, or</p>
<p class="neg-indent">3. Through its sale to the bank.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In all of these cases the credit goes to Notes
Receivable. In cases 1 and 3, the asset increased, viz., Cash, is
debited; and in case 2 the liability canceled or decreased is debited.
It may be stated, however, that in cases 2 and 3, instead of making
the credit direct to the asset account Notes Receivable, it is better
carried to a supplementary account, Notes Receivable Discounted, in
order to show the liability arising from the fact that, through our
indorsement, we guarantee to pay the note at its maturity in case the
maker fails to do so. This is later explained in detail.</p>

<p class="space-above1">The balance owing us by a customer is an asset,
and therefore a debit item.</p>

<p>Goods sold on account are charged to the customer because our claim
against him constitutes an asset; at the same time the income account,
Sales, is credited.</p>

<p>When a customer pays us on account, his account is credited and Cash is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
debited, showing an increase of the asset Cash and a decrease of the
asset Accounts Receivable. Such an entry is simply a transfer from one
account to another, an increase of one asset offset by a decrease of
another asset.</p>

<p>When a customer gives us his note, his account is credited and Notes
Receivable is debited, usually, with the face of the note.</p>

<p>When a customer returns goods to us, he is credited to decrease
the original charge to his account and Sales or Returned Sales is
debited to reduce the income originally credited to Sales. It is not
necessary to make any other record of the returned goods, because, as
was explained in <a href="#Page_44">Chapter VI</a>, no day-to-day record
is kept to show the decrease of the asset Merchandise through Sales.
So, when goods are returned by a customer, the increase of the asset
Merchandise will be shown at the end of the fiscal period when the
merchandise inventory is taken, and no other record than that indicated
is necessary.</p>

<p>When a customer is allowed a discount for the early payment of his
bill, he is credited to reduce the original charge by the amount of the
discount, and some temporary proprietorship account, as Discount on
Sales, is debited to show the decrease in proprietorship resulting from
the allowance of the discount.</p>

<p>When a customer is allowed a claim for reduction in his bill on account
of damaged goods or the like, the entry is similar to the one next
above—debit Claims and Allowances and credit the customer.</p>

Entries in the Merchandise account require no explanation excepting
the debit entry (3). The value of the asset Merchandise is not the
price paid for it at the point where purchased, for it is of no value
to the business until it is placed on the shelves ready for sale.
Accordingly, the value of the asset Merchandise is not determined
merely by the price paid the vendor, but by this price plus all of the
costs necessary to bring the merchandise to the store. Inasmuch as the
merchandise is sold normally for more than it cost, the credit entry
in the Merchandise account includes two items: (1) the decrease of the
asset, as indicated by the cost price of the goods sold; and (2) the
amount of profit on the sale, that is, the amount of the increase in
proprietorship.</p>

<p>The record of merchandise transactions is thus seen to be rather
complex and will be explained fully in <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a>.
The above schedule is simply an indication of the types of transactions
recorded in the Merchandise account and will be sufficient for the
present. It will be seen that the sale of goods results in a debit to
the customer’s account and a credit to Merchandise.</p>

<p><b>Accounts with Fixed Assets.</b>—Accounts with fixed assets are
those with land, buildings, and equipment of all sorts.</p>

<p>The debit to this account is not for invoice or first cost only,
but should include all expenditures necessary to secure full title
or to place the equipment in position for use by the business, such
as abstract of title costs, freight, drayage, and, in the case of
machinery, setting-up and placement costs. The corresponding credit is
usually to Cash, or to Notes or Accounts Payable.</p>

<p>The account is credited for the sale of all or a portion of the asset
at the same price at which it was originally charged, so that the
balance in the account shows the pro rata cost of the part left. A loss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
from fire or otherwise is treated similarly. If the asset is sold at
a profit (an unlikely occurrence), the account is credited with its
cost price, while the excess of the sale price over the cost price
is credited to a proprietorship account, such as Profit on Sale of
Machinery. The debit corresponding to these two credits is usually to
Cash or some other asset received in payment. Where the asset is sold
at a loss, the account is credited with: (1) the sum received, and
(2) the difference between this sum and the cost of the asset, which
difference represents a loss. The loss or deficiency is debited to a
proprietorship account, such as Loss on Sale of Machinery, and the
additional debit is to Cash or some other asset received. This latter
debit amount plus the debit to Loss on Sale of Machinery must, of
course, equal the two amounts credited to the fixed asset account and
representing the cost of the asset sold.</p>

<p>Fixed asset accounts are further considered in <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a>,
where the manner of recording loss through depreciation is shown.</p>

<p><b>Accounts with Notes Payable.</b>—When we issue our own note, the
credit is to Notes Payable and the debit is either to the liability
account reduced or to the asset account increased. When we call the
note in, either by paying it or by canceling our claim against the
person returning the note, Notes Payable is debited and Cash or the
person returning the note is credited.</p>

<p><b>Other Liability Accounts.</b>—Accounts with other liabilities, such
as Mortgages, Bonds, Expenses Payable, and the like, follow in the main
the general principles laid down (<a href="#Page_81">pages 81 to 83</a>).
Specific treatment will be given them as they are met in the
discussion. In the case of long-time notes payable supported by

<span class="h_subtitle">DEBIT AND CREDIT AS APPLIED<br />
TO PROPRIETORSHIP ACCOUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Proprietorship Accounts Defined.</b>—Proprietorship accounts are
the accounts which record the effects, both temporary and ultimate,
of business transactions upon proprietorship. The study of the two
preceding chapters has made clear the fact that transactions which
involve the receipt of income or the payment of expenses result
respectively in an increase or decrease of proprietorship, and that
these increases or decreases are temporarily recorded in suitable
income and expense accounts until the close of the fiscal period, at
which time the accounts are summarized to determine the net effect of
all transactions upon proprietorship or the capital invested in the
business. Therefore, the proprietorship accounts are of two general
kinds: temporary and vested. Temporary proprietorship accounts make
temporary and immediate record of the results of the agencies or forces
at work within the business to produce a profit. They set forth the
efforts to increase the net worth of the business. They record the
costs of the effort and its yield in earnings, the record being made
under appropriate titles to show the kind of cost and the source of the
yield. Vested proprietorship accounts record the ultimate or summarized
results of business transactions. They therefore record the original
investment and its subsequent net increases and decreases.</p>

<p><b>Fundamental Consideration of Proprietorship Debits and
Credits.</b>—Income and expenses comprise the temporary proprietorship
items which, after being summarized, show their ultimate effect upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
vested proprietorship. In other words, they are proprietorship items
set up temporarily to furnish detailed information for aiding in
efficient management and control and are later transferred to the
ultimate or vested proprietorship records. Since, from the mathematical
necessity of the proprietorship equation, proprietorship items normally
have credit balances, it is evident that all income, or earnings,
must be placed on the credit side of their appropriate accounts. Cost
of management and all expenses of operation are deductions from that
income and must therefore be recorded on the left or debit side of
appropriately named accounts.</p>

<p><b>Income Debits and Credits.</b>—With regard to their debits and
credits, income accounts follow this rule:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0"
       summary=" " cellpadding="0" rules="cols" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc bb2" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Income</span><br />

   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl br"><i>Debit</i>:</td>

      <td class="tdl_ws1 br"><span class="ws3">yield shown contra.</span></td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Income accounts normally have entries only on the credit side. They are
debited, however, for the purpose of deducting from the yield shown
on the credit side, (1) because of overstatement of the amount of the
yield in the first place; (2) because of error in the original placing
of the item of income, which is now transferred to its proper account;
and (3) for the purpose of summarizing when it becomes necessary
to transfer all income and expense items to one summary account.
The entries made for the purposes of transfer and summarization are
sometimes called “adjusting” and “closing” entries.</p>

<p><b>Expense Debits and Credits.</b>—With regard to their debit and
credit, expense accounts follow this rule:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0"
       summary=" " cellpadding="0" rules="cols" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc bb2" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Expense</span><br />

      <td class="tdl_ws1 br">(1) For the cost.<span class="ws6"> </span></td>

      <td class="tdl_ws1 br"> </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1"><span class="ws3">shown contra.</span></td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Expense accounts normally have entries only on the debit side. Their
credits are for purposes similar to the debits to income accounts as
stated just above.</p>

<p>Examples of temporary proprietorship items can be found in
<a href="#Page_38">Chapters V</a>, <a href="#Page_44">VI</a>,
and <a href="#Page_57">VII</a>, where the profit and loss summary
is treated.</p>

<p><b>Vested Proprietorship Debits and Credits.</b>—Two accounts should
be kept on the ledger with the proprietor, a capital and a personal
account, i.e., “John Doe, Capital” and “John Doe, Personal.” The
capital account records the original investment or the amount of
capital now in the business as shown by the last financial statement.
The personal account shows all direct changes made in the capital
during the fiscal period either through withdrawal or the additional
investment of funds or properties. The capital account, therefore,
shows no change until the close of the fiscal period, when the increase
or decrease in net worth is transferred to it.</p>

<p>An exception to this is sometimes made when there is evident intention
to withdraw during the period some of the invested capital, in which
case such withdrawal is shown in the capital account as a debit or
subtraction item. Also, if there is evident intention to increase the
investment during the fiscal period, record of it is sometimes made in
the capital account. Practice in this regard is not uniform.</p>

<p>The ordinary transactions with the proprietor, such as more or less
regular withdrawals of cash or goods and other similar transactions,
are recorded in his personal account. This is his current account as
distinguished from his more permanent capital account. Both of these
accounts may be termed vested proprietorship accounts. Their debit and
credit schedule appears as follows:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0"
       summary=" " cellpadding="0" rules="cols" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc bb2" colspan="2">(<span class="smcap">Name of Account</span>)</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl br"><i>Debit</i>:</td>
      <td class="tdl"> <i>Credit</i>:</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1 br">(1) For amounts or values withdrawn. </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">(a) For amounts or values invested.</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="space-above1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
The capital account usually shows only one item throughout the
period until its close; the personal account shows both debits and
credits, made according to the above schedule. The personal account
ordinarily shows transactions of the following kind: on the debit
side, withdrawals in funds or goods, the payment or assumption by the
business of the personal debts of the proprietor, and his retention of
any funds or properties belonging to the business, such as collections
from customers; on the credit side, the investment in the business of
any funds or properties, the retention by the business of any funds or
properties belonging to the proprietor, as where the business collects
and retains a debt due him personally, and the payment or assumption by
him personally of any debts of the business.</p>

<p><b>Further Consideration of Expense Items.</b>—In explaining the
debits to fixed asset accounts it was pointed out that all costs
necessary to place the asset in position for use by the business
constituted a part of the value of the asset and should be recorded in
the asset account. Similarly, it was explained that in the Merchandise
account there was included as a part of the value of the merchandise
all the costs incident to putting the merchandise in position for sale
by the business. Costs of this kind are classed as incoming costs and
are almost without exception treated as additions to the value of the
asset. The costs incurred from this point on, in the course of business
operations, are classed as expenses or proprietorship decreases.</p>

<p>It might sometimes appear that all these operating costs—the kind
shown in the profit and loss statement—also add to the value of the
assets of the business. Such is not the case. In a mercantile concern,
business is conducted for the purpose of selling merchandise. Profit
arises through the purchase of merchandise at one price and its sale
at a price sufficiently higher to pay for all operating expenses and
leave a margin. The cost of merchandise to the customer reimburses
the proprietor for his original outlay in merchandise and for a fair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
portion of the operating expenses incident to the maintenance of the
store. The customer is willing to pay this additional amount because
it is cheaper for him to pay the merchant a margin over the cost of
the merchandise sufficient to induce the merchant to conduct a market
for merchandise, than to undergo the necessary expenditures—of time,
expense, and inconvenience—entailed in making the purchase from the
original vendor.</p>

<p>The economic organization of business is based on this hypothesis.
In the management of a business there is a very large element of
risk. The sale price of commodities at a given time is not always
determined on the basis of the original cost of the commodity plus
the costs of maintaining a store for its sale. Competition sometimes
enters in to drive the price down below this amount. While every
merchant <i>expects</i> in the long run to receive from the sale of his
merchandise not only what he himself has paid for it but also the cost
of conducting his store and a fair margin of profit, for a given period
and for a given item of merchandise he may not be so fortunate.</p>

<p>In recording business transactions, therefore, prudence demands that
the costs of operating the business be not recorded as increases in
the value of the merchandise dealt in, but rather that they be set
up separately and charged against the income received from the sale
of the merchandise before the increase (or decrease) in the value
of the assets is determined and made a part of the asset record. As
merchandise is converted into cash the amount received is recorded as
an increase in the asset cash. This cash includes the original cost of
the merchandise plus some of the costs of operating the business. These
are costs which must be incurred and they add value to the business as
indicated by the willingness of the customer to pay the merchant for
them. Because the added value is problematical at the time the costs
are incurred, they are recorded as expenditures which must be made good
out of the sale of the merchandise at a sufficiently enhanced price to
cover them, i.e., they are <i>expenses</i> which are to be treated as
deductions from sales income.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>The net difference between the income and the cost of securing the
income, as indicated by the expense accounts, will represent the value
added to the assets of the business, and will therefore be reflected
tangibly in an increase in the value of the assets by that amount. This
increase will usually be reflected either in the cash holdings or in
claims against customers.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place at this point to call attention to the
fact that, as the bookkeeping record is usually handled, the only
relationship between asset increases, liability decreases, and
expenses (proprietorship decreases) arises from the fact that all of
them are debits and are so placed because of the mathematics of the
fundamental equation on which double entry rests. Assets, liabilities,
and proprietorship are three distinct and separate groups of accounts
related only by the logic of the proprietorship equation. As the
subject of accounting is developed the student will see the increasing
importance of drawing sharply the lines of division among these groups
and he will see also the difficulty at times of maintaining this
distinction.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">DEBIT AND CREDIT AS APPLIED<br />TO MIXED ACCOUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Mixed Accounts Defined.</b>—In the course of business operations
certain accounts which at the beginning of the period belong definitely
to some one of the three groups, asset, liability, and proprietorship,
with the progress of the period take on a mixed character. That is,
included under one account title there is a mixed record of asset and
expense, or other combination of two or more groups. For example, the
machinery which belongs to the asset group at the beginning of the
period depreciates in value day by day, both through use and the lapse
of time. This daily decrease in value is of slight amount and in the
management of the business it is not necessary that it be shown on the
books. While it is theoretically possible to record this daily loss,
practically nothing would be gained by so doing. Hence, the machinery
account is allowed to carry both the asset value of the machinery at
a given time and the amount of its depreciation. Only periodically,
usually at the close of each fiscal period, is the account separated
into its two parts, the one which shows the true asset value and the
other which indicates the amount of depreciation and which is therefore
the expense or proprietorship-decrease portion of the account.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter the way in which the Merchandise account takes
on a mixed character was briefly explained. It was shown that the
credit side reflected both a decrease of the asset and an increase of
the proprietorship by the amount of the gross profit on the goods sold.
Thus, because of the way in which accounts are kept practically, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
distinguished from a theoretically correct method, which would maintain
at all times a sharp line of division between assets, liabilities, and
proprietorship, certain accounts are allowed to become mixed. It is
the purpose of this chapter to discuss the proper handling of the more
common mixed accounts.</p>

<p><b>Analysis of a Sale Transaction.</b>—The impracticability of
immediately separating each sale of goods into its two elements of
cost and profit and the taking of a physical inventory as a means to
this end, was discussed in <a href="#Page_44">Chapter VI</a>. The
necessity for this later separation may be made clear by analyzing
a sale transaction.</p>

<p>Suppose an article costing $10 is sold for $12. At the time of its
purchase a debit was made to Merchandise account and a credit, say, to
Cash. When the article is sold, it would seem that the credit should be
to Merchandise to show the decrease in that asset. However, in the sale
price of $12 is included something more than the amount by which the
stock of merchandise is decreased. This additional amount is the profit
of $2. Hence, a credit to Merchandise of $12 would result in too large
a subtraction from the asset Merchandise, if it is intended that the
Merchandise account shall always show by its balance the value of the
unsold stock. Theoretically the best method of entering this sale would
be to debit Cash for $12, and to credit Merchandise with $10 and Profit
with $2.</p>

<p><b>The Old Merchandise Account, Its Content and Significance.</b>—It
is impracticable, however, to compute and record the cost of every unit
sold. Using the above illustration, instead of crediting Merchandise
with $10 and Profit with $2, the entire $12 may be credited to the
Merchandise account. There is a disadvantage in this procedure, in
that the Merchandise account then no longer represents the one asset
Merchandise, but is a mixture of an asset element, merchandise, and a
proprietorship element, profit; two elements which must be separated at
the close of the period.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Originally, the Merchandise account was kept in this way; it was a
<i>mixed</i> account and followed the rules of debit and credit as
shown below, the amounts being given for purposes of illustration:</p>

<p class="space-above1">Where the account is kept in this manner it is
usually burdened with the additional data listed under (3), (4), (b),
and (c). Sales being a credit item, it is plain that subtractions from
sales (3) and (4), must appear on the debit side, and, purchases being
a debit item, subtractions from purchases (b) and (c) must appear on
the credit side. If these subtractions were actually performed instead
of being indicated in the account, the debit side would show net goods
to be accounted for, viz., goods on hand at the beginning, $10,000,
plus <i>net</i> purchases, $17,900, making a total of $27,900; and the
credit side would show <i>net</i> sales, $25,000 minus $1,500, or $23,500.</p>

<p>If, now, the cost value of the goods on hand at the close of the period
(as determined by a physical inventory) equals $8,000, it is evident
that the cost price of the goods sold is equal to the cost value of
the goods to be accounted for, minus the cost value of the goods left
on hand, that is, $27,900 minus $8,000, or $19,900. To secure this
subtraction within the account, it is necessary to enter on the credit
side this $8,000, the cost value of the final inventory. Accordingly,
an additional credit item (d) is inserted, after which the account will show:

<p class="space-above1">The account is now a pure proprietorship account,
the balance showing the gross profit on sales, amounting to $3,600.</p>

<p><b>Modern Practice in Showing Merchandising Transactions.</b>—Actual
subtraction, however, within the account is contrary to the method of
showing subtractions in the account. Therefore, the mixed Merchandise
account cannot show the figures representing “net purchases,” “net
sales,” “total goods to be accounted for,” and “cost of goods
sold”—information which is very essential to proper management. While
containing all the data necessary to give the final information, viz.,
the “gross profit,” the mixed account does not show the separate
factors leading up to it. Analysis of the mixed account is necessary to
find the elements of which it is composed. The best accounting practice
provides for this analysis as the transaction takes place. The old
Merchandise account is no longer used; in its place separate accounts
are set up to represent the various elements mentioned above. Each
account thus contains only one kind of item as indicated by its title.
These accounts are:</p>

Accounts <b>(1), (2), (3), (7),</b> and <b>(8)</b> correspond to the
four classes of debits shown above in the mixed Merchandise account,
and accounts <b>(1), (4), (5),</b> and <b>(6)</b> correspond to the
credits. Explanation of the use of account <b>(1)</b> for both the
initial and final inventories is given in detail in <a href="#Page_115">Chapter XV</a>.</p>

<p>The advantage of the use of these accounts instead of the one
Merchandise account is in the availability of the information they
contain and in the saving of labor, because now there is no need to
analyze the Merchandise account for information relating to returns,
allowances, and so forth. By later transferring the totals of the
Returned Sales and of the Sales Rebates and Allowances to the Sales
account, the balance of this account will show the “net sales.” A
similar transfer of the Inward Freight and Drayage, the Returned
Purchases, and the Purchases Rebates and Allowances to the Purchases
account, and a transfer to it of the initial and final inventories,
make it show by its balance the “cost of goods sold” which set over
against “net sales” shows the figure of “gross profit.”</p>

<p>The student will understand that the use of these detailed accounts
does not free the record of merchandise transactions from the mixture
of different elements, decrease of the asset and increase of the
profits. It does, however, make the record more valuable because of the
information it makes available.</p>

<p><b>Accounts with Assets Subject to Depreciation.</b>—Another kind of
mixed account requiring explanation is that of the fixed asset subject
to depreciation. Due to ordinary wear and tear, and some other causes,
most fixed assets lose part of their value as time goes by. At the end
of each fiscal period the amount of this loss and the present value of
the asset must be estimated, after an inventory has been taken, when
necessary, of their number, weight, or other units of measurement. Such
an estimate is called an appraisal. The difference between the present
appraised value of the asset and its former cost or appraised value
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
constitutes the loss from wear or other causes, and is termed
depreciation.</p>

<p>Since depreciation takes place day by day, but for practical reasons
cannot be recorded daily, fixed asset accounts, as they stand valued
in the ledger, represent true asset values only for the date of their
entry. Except on that date, these accounts, then, include depreciation
and hence are mixed accounts including both asset and proprietorship
elements. As with the Merchandise account, an adjustment is made
periodically to separate the two elements. Since the asset account is
a debit account, entry of the amount of the depreciation to the credit
side would result in the account showing, by its balance, the appraised
value of the asset at any given time. It is, however, desirable to
leave the account in its original condition, in order not to lose sight
of the cost of the asset. Therefore the usual practice is to enter this
figure of depreciation to the credit side of a separate account called
Depreciation Reserve for the particular asset, using the word “reserve”
in the sense of “estimate.”</p>

<p>If the latter method is followed, each asset has two accounts, one
showing original cost and the other estimated depreciation, and it is
necessary for a true valuation of the asset to read the two accounts
together; that is, from the asset account showing original cost, the
amount credited to the reserve account must be deducted to show the
true value of the asset. Because of this, the reserve account is often
called a valuation account or an offset account, as it gives the amount
of the offset to the original asset account necessary to show its
correct value. Similarly, when an increment in the value of an asset is
kept separate from its face or par value—as when the premium paid for
stock or bonds is shown separately from the par value of the stock or
bonds—the account showing the increment is called an adjunct account
and must be read with the asset account to secure true valuation. The
offset account, then, is a subtraction item and the adjunct an addition
item to the corresponding asset account. The showing of the asset and
its periodic valuation is made as follows:

<p>A reading of the two accounts taken together shows the original value
of machinery as $5,000, the value after one year’s use $4,500 and after
two year’s use $4,000. The contra debit for the credit in the reserve
account is made to an account called Depreciation, which represents
the expense of the depreciation for the period, that is, the deduction
from profit or proprietorship. Sometimes, this charge is made direct to
Profit and Loss, as will be shown in a later chapter.</p>

<p><b>Capital and Revenue Expenditures.</b>—The fixed asset accounts
usually show the investment of some of the original capital and
therefore are sometimes called capital asset accounts. A fundamental
distinction must be made between expenditures for the purchase and
installation of the asset itself and expenditures for expenses in
connection with its repairs, maintenance, and upkeep. These two classes
of expenditures are usually called “capital expenditures” and “revenue
expenditures” respectively.</p>

<p>The asset account itself is chargeable with all costs incurred up
to the point of putting the asset in shape for use in the business.
It may be charged also with subsequent expenditures resulting in an
increase in its value. Expenditures, however, which are for the purpose
of repairs or of keeping the property from too rapid depreciation
without adding anything to its original value, must be charged to a
properly labeled <i>expense</i> account. These revenue expenditures
for expenses, such as repairs, maintenance, upkeep, together with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
depreciation, are subtractions from profit and proprietorship, while
asset expenditures usually constitute an exchange of the asset cash for
some other asset, which exchange has no effect on proprietorship.</p>

<p>Sometimes two items of expenditure are seemingly of the same nature,
while in fact they belong to separate groups, as the original painting
cost of a building and the cost incurred later for repainting. In the
first instance the expenditure is an asset, a part of the original
cost necessary to put the building in a finished condition; in the
other instance, it is an expense necessary to maintain the asset in
something near its original condition. In order to secure accuracy
in the records, careful discrimination between capital and revenue
expenditures is a matter of great importance.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">PERIODIC WORK ON THE LEDGER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The work preliminary to summarizing the record of transactions for a
period and preparing the balance sheet and profit and loss statement
is comprised under three heads: (1) the Trial Balance, (2) Adjusting
Entries, and (3) Closing Entries. These three steps will be discussed
at this point sufficiently for practice work in closing the ledger.
Fuller treatment of the subject is reserved for later chapters, after
the nature of the transactions that may complicate the closing of the
ledger have been explained.</p>

<p><b>The Trial Balance.</b>—When all transactions for the fiscal period
have been entered on the ledger, it is desirable to make sure that
the ledger is in equilibrium, i.e., to make sure that for every entry
on the debit side there is an equal credit entry, and that for every
credit entry there is an equal debit entry; in other words, that the
ledger equation explained in Chapters <a href="#Page_72">IX</a> and
<a href="#Page_78">X</a> is maintained. This proof of the mathematical
correctness of the ledger is accomplished by means of a device called
the “Trial Balance,” which consists of a debit and credit list of
either all account totals or of all account balances. If the total
debits equal the total credits, the mathematical equilibrium is
demonstrated. A trial balance is usually set up somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class="space-above2"><b>Work Preliminary to the Trial
Balance.</b>—Before taking a trial balance, the accounts should be
totaled on each side. These totals are shown in small but legible
pencil figures immediately beneath the last entry, sufficient space
being left for a regular entry on the line immediately below the
pencil footing. Reference to the illustration in <a href="#FORM_3">Form 3</a>
makes this bookkeeping detail clear. The difference between the totals of
the account should now be shown in pencil in the explanation column on the
side of the larger amount. Taking the trial balance thus becomes merely
a transcription of pencil balances, debit or credit as the case may be,
from the list of accounts.</p>

<p><b>Balancing an Account.</b>—Sometimes it is desirable, as in the Cash
account, to show on the face of the account the difference between the
total debits and credits, i.e., the balance of the account. This may be
accomplished by writing the balance on the side with the smaller total,
and by formally ruling up the account and entering in ink the totals on
both sides, which totals, of course, are now equal. It should be noted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
that the total rules in the money columns are drawn on the same line
on both sides of the account, thus leaving several blank lines on the
debit side. This is done so that the entries in the new section of the
account will start on the same line for both debits and credits. On the
next line below the double ruling, the balance item is brought down
to its proper side. The account is now said to have been closed as to
all items above the rulings and shows its open balance in the one item
beneath the rulings. The method of balancing and ruling accounts is
illustrated in the Cash account shown in <a href="#FORM_3">Form 3</a>.</p>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that the closing balance of the account
is on the side showing the smaller <i>pencil</i> total, whereas the
opening balance which appears beneath the ruling is on the opposite
side. The only purpose of the entry on the smaller side is to force an
equality of the two sides, thus formally closing all entries to that
point and showing the “balance” as a single item in the new portion of
the account.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that this “balance” entry does not disturb the
equilibrium of the books, because it is entered on both the debit and
credit sides of the same account.</p>

<p><b>Use of Red Ink.</b>—The total and closing rulings and the balancing
entry are sometimes made in red ink, but black ink is preferable. The
use of red ink is usually reserved for recording subtraction items in
the same column with those from which the subtraction is to be made.
Where red ink is so used, the total of the “red” is subtracted from the
total of the “black” amounts and the net result is shown in the total
of the column. When there are only a few “red” items, this method of
recording obviates the use of a separate column for them. Such red ink
entries are not found in the standard ledger, being confined to special
ledgers and columnar statements of various kinds.

  <p class="f120">Form 3. Account Balanced and Ruled</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
<b>Rulings.</b>—The single lines above the totals, indicating the
addition, extend only through the money columns and are on the same
line on both debit and credit sides. The closing rulings beneath the
footings are double and extend through the date columns, the money
columns, and the posting reference columns. The diagonal line on the
debit side from the total line to the date column for the last entry is
for the purpose of filling all blank lines, and preventing any further
entries on them after the account is formally closed, as such entries
would have the effect of falsifying the totals shown. Thus the diagonal
line which may be on either debit or credit side serves as a safeguard
against fraud. Diagonal rulings, however, are not used so extensively
as formerly.</p>

<p><b>Transferring.</b>—When for any reason it is desirable to transfer
an account from one page to another, the transfer is made by means
of an entry similar to the “balance” entry shown in the Cash account
above. Instead of the word “Balance,” the word “Transfer” or “Forward”
is used, and in the column between the explanation and money columns
is entered the number of the page to which the transfer is made. On
that page the account name appears, and the first entry is the amount
transferred from the old account, with a page reference to the old
account in the reference column. In making the transfer it is customary
to close the portion of the account on the old page in the manner
explained above, and to transfer only the balance.</p>

<p>Sometimes an entry may be made in an account in error and for this or
some other reason may need to be transferred. Assuming, for the purpose
of illustration, that such an entry is a credit, its amount is first
written as a subtraction item on the debit side in the old account,
with proper reference to the page to which it goes. On the new page
it appears on the credit side, like the original item, and may be
considered as the contra to its transfer record in the old account. In
the new account the old page number must be entered. Great care should
be exercised in all transfer entries to show correct cross-indexing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes it is desired to transfer not the balance but the total
debits and credits of an account. In this case the total debit amount
may be entered on the credit side of the old account and the total
credit amount on the debit side, with proper page and explanatory
references. This forces the equality of the two sides and the account
may now be totaled and ruled off. The total debit amount of the old
account is then entered on the debit side and the total credit amount
on the credit side of the new account.</p>

<p>A much simpler and more workable method, however, is to treat the
new account as a continuation of the old. There is then no necessity
of formally balancing the old account. The transfer is effected by
totaling both sides of the old account and indicating the new page to
which these totals are transferred, taking care to enter the totals on
the proper side of the new account, with proper references to the old
account page. This procedure is illustrated in <a href="#FORM_4">Form 4</a>.</p>

<p><b>Rulings and Entries in Personal and Note Accounts.</b>—Some
peculiarities met with in the entries and rulings of personal and note
accounts, both receivable and payable, will be discussed here.</p>

<p>In John Adams’ personal account (<a href="#FORM_5">Form 5</a>) notice
that his address is included in the heading, that the terms of credit
extended to him on each sale are shown in the explanation space on
the debit side, and that his payments are entered on the credit side
according to the date on which they are received. If a payment appears
directly opposite the corresponding charge, with no other credits
intervening, lines are ruled underneath both the debit and the credit
items to show that down to that point the account balances. The record
of dealings with each customer should be as full as possible in order
to furnish an accurate basis for credit rating. If he is prompt in his
payments, taking advantage of the discounts offered him, the account
should show this.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
A convenient method of showing clearly the taking of discounts, without
the need of calculating the time between dates of charge and payment,
is to enter the discount in small ink figures above the net amount
received. When two partial payments are made, as on October 1 and 15,
to settle the charge of September 20, and there are no other credits
intervening, the two credits, with the total in small figures, may be
ruled off against the single charge. At the time the trial balance is
taken—in the illustration on August 31, September 30, and October
31—the balance of the account is calculated and shown in pencil on its
proper side, debit or credit, just to the left of the reference column
on the line of the last entry on that side.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when payments are made out of order or on account and it
is desired to show to what particular charges they apply, an index
number or letter showing the cross-reference is used, as shown in the
Notes Payable account. As notes are issued by the business, they may be
numbered, and when it pays a particular note, the entry should show the
number of that note.</p>

<p>These remarks apply also to notes receivable. If full payment is
received on each note as it comes due, the entry may be made on the
same line on which the note was first recorded. This may result in the
entries to the account appearing out of chronological order, but it
assists in an easy determination of the outstanding notes. Numbering,
or preferably lettering, the entries in an account may be applied with
advantage also to the entries in personal accounts, as it aids in
locating unpaid items, especially where payments cannot be recorded in
the order in which the items to be settled have been entered.</p>

<p>The method of ruling and thus canceling items as explained above, is
usually limited to notes and accounts receivable and payable, that
is, to the accounts on which particular payments are received or made
and the balance of which it is desirable to ascertain at frequent
intervals. On the other hand, it is advisable that the method of
showing periodic balances, by means of small pencil figures for use in
the trial balance, be applied to all accounts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS AND<br /> SUMMARIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Why Current Records of the Ledger Need Adjustment.</b>—At the end
of the fiscal period the ledger does not present a true record of
financial condition. The fixed assets of the business are constantly
depreciating in value; merchandise tends to become out of date,
shopworn, stale, or soiled; some merchandise has been sold, while
some is still on hand; some of the accounts receivable may prove
uncollectible, and some of the notes receivable may be dishonored.
Also, at the end of the period liabilities such as taxes, salaries,
rent, and the like may have been incurred, but because there is
no creditor’s invoice or other business paper as evidence of such
liability they are not usually entered on the books until payment is made.</p>

<p>Again, it may be that the services paid for during this period, as
shown by the various expense accounts, have not been entirely used, as
where a supply of coal for heating purposes remains on hand, or when,
as in the case of insurance bought for a given period of time, a part
of the protection period extends beyond the close of the current fiscal
period. In these and similar cases, the items must be separated into
their two component elements, one part belonging to the current period,
and the other part to a later period. The part of the expense to be
deferred and used up in a later period represents an asset at the close
of the current period and must therefore appear on the balance sheet
under the heading of “Deferred Charges.”</p>

<p>Similarly, income is sometimes received in advance to cover services
which have not yet been rendered, or rendered only in part, as when
rent is received in advance to cover a given number of months, some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
which belong to the next fiscal period. Consequently, only a part of
this income applies to the current period, the balance being deferred
to later periods.</p>

<p>For these reasons certain asset accounts need to be adjusted and
certain liability accounts must be opened to bring the ledger into
accord with the actual condition of things and show the true financial
status of the business. The entries required for this purpose are
called “adjustment entries” to distinguish them from the closing or
summarizing entries to be described later in this chapter.</p>

<p>First in importance among the adjusting entries are those required to
show the correct value of the stock-in-trade, the fixed assets, and
the accounts receivable. Whether the merchandise items are kept in
one or several accounts, the value of the stock on hand is not shown
at any given time during the fiscal period. Goods have been purchased
at one price and sold at another, and no record of the value of the
merchandise inventory on hand is available. Similarly, no current
record has been made of the depreciation of buildings, furniture,
fixtures, or other equipment, nor has any provision been made for the
accounts receivable that may prove uncollectible.</p>

<p><b>Basis of Adjustment Entries.</b>—These items, then, merchandise,
asset depreciation, bad debts, prepaid and accrued expenses and income,
are the occasion of the adjustment entries. An inventory is required
to find the value of the stock-in-trade; an appraisal is made of the
depreciating assets to determine the amount of depreciation for the
current period; and proper consideration must be given to the prepaid
and accrued income and expense items for the period under review. The
following illustrations are concerned with the several classes of
adjustment entries. The detail of the account is not shown in each
case, but only the balance.</p>

<p><b>Adjusting and Closing the Merchandise Records.</b>—Unlike the method
shown in the debit and credit schedule for merchandise in <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
the modern practice is to keep the merchandise record by means of
the separate accounts used in the profit and loss statement, viz.,
Merchandise Inventory, Purchases, Inward Freight and Cartage, Returned
Purchases, Purchases Rebates and Allowances, Sales, Returned Sales,
and Sales Rebates and Allowances. It should be understood that this
detailed record of merchandise transactions is preferable to the
single merchandise account only because it gives more information.
The detailed record does not in any way maintain a sharper separation
of the asset and income elements of the merchandise transactions
than does the single merchandise account. It does, however, make
immediately available information as to volume of business, purchases,
returns, and so forth—items which in any well-managed business are
watched carefully. These detailed accounts taken together comprise the
merchandise record and are equivalent to the single merchandise account.</p>

<p>It is apparent from a consideration of the single merchandise account
that at any given time it includes these three items: (1) the net cost
of the total goods to be accounted for; (2) the decrease in the asset
merchandise brought about by sale; and (3) the profit on the goods
sold. In order to bring about the separation of the merchandise records
into the two elements (a) goods still on hand, that is, the asset
element, and (b) the profit on goods sold, that is, the income element,
it is necessary to bring the detailed accounts together for the purpose
of summarization. This summarization is accomplished in much the same
way as in the profit and loss statement. The net amount of sales and
the net cost of goods sold are determined and set up against each
other in order to indicate the gross profit. In arriving at the cost
of goods sold it is necessary to bring together the opening inventory,
the purchases, the inward freight and cartage, and from their sum to
subtract the purchase returns, the purchase rebates and allowances,
and the final inventory. How this is accomplished in the ledger is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
explained by an illustration, in which the adjustments or transfers
between accounts are traced by means of cross-index letters.</p>

<p>Assume the following facts: Goods on hand January 1, 19—, $10,125.67;
purchases for six months $47,897.42; inward freight and cartage
$560.25; returned purchases $2,125.40; purchase rebates and allowances
$267.92; sales $65,283.21; returned sales $3,924.83; sales rebates
and allowances $392.48; and goods on hand June 30, 19—, $11,267.40.
Each of these items appears as the first entry on the proper side of
its account, and is distinguished by not being marked with a bracketed
letter. The items comprise the ledger record previous to summarization
at the close of the fiscal period.</p>

<p class="space-above2">To show the total cost of goods bought during
the period, the freight-in of $560.25 is transferred or closed into
Purchases. To show the “<i>gross</i> cost of goods to be accounted
for,” amounting to $58,583.34, the inventory of January 1 of $10,125.67
is transferred to the debit side of Purchases account. To show the
<i>net</i> cost of goods to be accounted for, the returned purchases
and allowances are deducted from this gross cost by being transferred
to the credit side of Purchases. The balance in Purchases account at
this point, viz., $58,583.34 minus $2,393.32, or $56,190.02, indicates
the net cost of goods to be accounted for.</p>

<p>This item of $56,190.02 is not indicated in the account, however, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
is given here simply to make the discussion intelligible. Part of
this $56,190.02 (net cost of goods to be accounted for), amounting to
$11,267.40, is the cost value of the unsold goods according to the
inventory of June 30, and the balance of $44,922.62 ($56,190.02 minus
$11,267.40) constitutes therefore the <i>cost of the goods sold</i>.
This final inventory is also shown as an asset on the debit side of
Merchandise Inventory in the new section of the account, i.e., the
portion of the account following the <i>initial</i> inventory section
which has now been closed and ruled off as shown on <a href="#Page_118">page 118</a>.</p>

<p>Put in a somewhat different form, we may say that the cost of
goods sold is found by subtracting from the gross cost of goods to
be accounted for, $58,583.34, first the returns and the rebates,
$2,393.32, and then the amount of the closing inventory of June 30,
$11,267.40. The balance left of $44,922.62 represents the <i>cost of
goods sold</i>. This balance is now transferred to the debit of Profit
and Loss account.</p>

<p>All the transfer entries given above have their debits and credits
determined as explained in <a href="#Page_106">Chapter XIV</a>. The
student should note that the same additions and subtractions are thus
brought about in the Purchases account as are made arithmetically in
the section of the profit and loss statement given over to cost of
goods sold.</p>

<p>The Sales account is debited with the balances of the Returned, Sales
and Sales Rebates and Allowances, thus showing a balance of net income
from sales which is transferred to the credit of Profit and Loss.
The Profit and Loss account then shows net income from sales on the
credit side, and cost of goods sold on the debit side. The difference
between the two sides is gross profit on sales. All of the merchandise
accounts, except the Inventory account, are now balanced, and should be
ruled off in the manner explained in <a href="#Page_106">Chapter XIV</a>.</p>

<p>The second illustration covers the case where the stock-in-trade record
is kept in one mixed account called Merchandise. Using the same data as
in the other illustration, the account appears as follows:

<p>When the merchandise record is kept under separate accounts the
freight-in is <i>transferred</i> to the debit of the Purchases account;
but when a single mixed account is kept with merchandise, freight-in
is usually entered directly to the debit of that account. To adjust
the account when kept in this manner, the new inventory is entered
to the credit of Merchandise. The balance of the Merchandise account
now shows the gross profit on sales, $16,043.28. This is transferred
to the credit of Profit and Loss. (It will be noted that this
<i>transferred</i> item is identical with the <i>balance</i> of the
Profit and Loss account of the first illustration.) The Merchandise
account is now totaled and ruled off. On the debit side, beneath the
ruling, the new inventory is entered, being the contra to the credit
entry of $11,267.40 above the ruling. The equilibrium of debits and
credits is thus maintained. In this open item of $11,267.40 the account
shows an asset, the goods on hand June 30.</p>

<p>The handling of merchandise transactions according to the second
illustration is not considered good accounting but is shown because it
is frequently met with in bookkeeping practice.</p>

<p><b>Underlying Theory in the Adjustment of Merchandise
Records.</b>—Careful analysis and study of the adjustment of the
merchandise records should be made in order to see the way in which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
logic of the trading section of the profit and loss statement is worked
out in the ledger. The record of the merchandise asset should be
kept, in strict theory, in the same way as that of every other asset,
namely, the accounts should be charged with the full cost of the asset
and credited at cost price with the portion sold, the profit or loss
on the sale being carried in a separate account. The balance of the
Merchandise account would then show the value of the asset merchandise
on hand at any time.</p>

<p>Theory, however, gives way to the practical difficulties of handling
the account in this way. Therefore, periodically the mixture of
asset decreases and income increases brought about through this
practical method of handling merchandise records must be corrected,
or “unmixed,” so that these elements will appear separately. The
Purchases account, after the opening inventory, the inward freight,
and the purchase returns, rebates, and allowances are transferred to
it, gives the net total of the merchandise asset for the period. This
net total represents two things: (1) merchandise still on hand, and
(2) merchandise sold. By way of adjusting the records, the goods on
hand, as shown by the physical inventory, are separated from the total
and put into the Merchandise Inventory account, which shows by its
title that it is an asset. That leaves in the Purchases account the
cost of goods sold. The credits which should indicate the decrease
in the asset, equal to the cost of goods sold, are found in the net
merchandise sales, as shown by the Sales account after transferring
to it the sales returns, rebates, and allowances. But these credits
are here mixed with the gross profit. The portion of the net sales
representing the cost of sales of merchandise should now, in strict
theory, be transferred from the Sales account to the Purchases account.
This transfer would effect the balancing of the Purchases account,
indicating that there are no merchandise asset values in that account,
these having been transferred to the Merchandise Inventory account. The
result of this theoretically correct procedure would be to bring about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
a segregation of the merchandise records into their two elements, the
asset element as shown by the Merchandise Inventory account and the
income element as shown by the remaining balance in the Sales account.</p>

<p>Once again, however, strict theory gives place to the more practical
need of requiring the accounts to give full information for management
purposes. Accordingly, instead of handling them in the way just
indicated, the adjustment procedure explained on <a href="#Page_118">pages 118 to 120</a>
is followed.</p>

<p><b>Handling Depreciation of Fixed Assets.</b>—As shown in <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a>,
the method of handling depreciation of assets consists of
nothing more than separating the expense element from the asset
element, both of which are carried currently under the title of the
asset. For reasons explained in <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a>,
the credit to the asset which effects the separation is not recorded in
the asset account but in a supplementary account entitled “Depreciation
Reserve” for the particular asset. This reserve account is an integral
part of the asset record and must always be considered in connection
with the asset account in determining the value of the asset. The
credit entry in the reserve account is a sort of suspended credit,
recorded there temporarily for purposes of information. The offsetting
debit to this credit is made in the expense account Depreciation.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The adjustment entry thus effects a separation
of the asset account into the two elements, (1) present value of the
asset as shown by the asset account and its depreciation reserve
account, and (2) the expense element recorded under the Depreciation
expense account. The following illustration indicates the bookkeeping
procedure:</p>

<p class="space-above2">The asset Furniture and Fixtures, valued at
$750 at the beginning of the year, is estimated by appraisal to have
depreciated 10%, or $75, during the half-year. This cost or expense
is charged to an account called Depreciation, and credited not to
Furniture and Fixtures, but to the valuation account “Depreciation
Reserve Furniture and Fixtures.” The Furniture and Fixtures account and
its valuation account, <i>taken together</i>, show the appraisal value
of $675. Thus the credit adjusting entry is made to record a decrease
in asset values. The Depreciation account, carrying the debit of $75,
is an expense account and is closed into Profit and Loss, just as any
other expense account is closed.</p>

<p><b>The Estimate for Doubtful Accounts.</b>—At the close of a fiscal
period, when an accurate statement of the financial condition of the
business is to be drawn up, all assets must be very carefully valued.
The bookkeeping procedure necessary to show the correct value of fixed
assets subject to depreciation has been explained. The outstanding
claims against customers also require evaluation. Every business man
knows from past experience that he will be unable to collect all of his
outstanding accounts. He may not know which of the accounts will prove
uncollectible, but he does know that there will be a loss in the sum
total of these claims against customers. The amount of this estimate is
based on past experience in each business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>A standard basis for the estimate is not possible because in some
businesses credit is extended much more carefully than in other
businesses and in some collections are followed up more vigorously
than in others. In making the estimate two methods are used, one
being a certain percentage of the outstanding accounts, the other
being a certain percentage of the sales made during the period. Where
experience shows the necessity, the loss from both outstanding accounts
and notes receivable is provided for.</p>

<p>The same bookkeeping procedure is used here as with the estimate of
depreciation. An expense account, usually entitled “Bad Debts,” is
debited, and an account called “Reserve for Doubtful Accounts” is
credited for the amount of the estimated loss. The effect of the entry
is to separate the claims against customers into their two elements,
namely, the true asset element, represented by the difference between
the asset account and its valuation reserve account, and the expense
element as indicated by the Bad Debts account.</p>

<p>The following illustration sets forth the method of handling bad debts
on the books of account:</p>

It is known, from past experience, that the asset Accounts Receivable,
$100,000 in this instance, will not be collected in full. To bring this
book value down to its real value, the estimated loss, which it is
thought will be 2% of the outstanding accounts, is reserved from their
value, that is, credited to a reserve account, which is to be taken
in conjunction with the asset account. The offsetting debit is to Bad
Debts, an expense account. It represents an expense which the current
period has to bear, and is closed into Profit and Loss with other
expense accounts.</p>

<p>The first account, Insurance, shows the method of handling a deferred
or prepaid expense. At the close of the period the account is a mixed
account, the unexpired portion of the insurance representing an asset
to be shown on the balance sheet as a deferred charge, the expired or
consumed portion representing an expense for the period to be closed
into Profit and Loss. Insurance has been paid, in this case for a
three-year term; hence only one-sixth of it is chargeable to the first
half-year, the remainder being deferred to later periods. The amount
of the inventory or unexpired portion is entered to the credit of the
account in order to effect subtraction of the amount, the balance of
$25 thereby showing the insurance cost for the current period. This
balance is carried to Profit and Loss. After closing the account, the
inventory is entered to the debit side below the ruling, thus showing
the so-called “deferred asset” portion which will appear in the balance
sheet.</p>

<p>The next account, Rent Income, is a mixed account with income and
liability elements. It shows that rent has been received for a period
which extends beyond the current fiscal period. On June 15, rent
for the period of, say, June 15 to September 15 was received. Only
one-sixth of this income applies to the term January 1 to June 30;
therefore the balance of $250 must be deferred or carried over to the
next fiscal period. The adjustment is made by an entry of $250 for
unearned rent on the debit side to effect its subtraction from the
earnings for the current period, thus reducing them to $50. This income
of $50 is transferred to the credit of the Profit and Loss account.
After the Rent account is ruled off, the deferred income is entered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
below the ruling on the credit side, forming a part of the earnings of
the next period. It is shown among the liabilities in the balance sheet
for the current period, usually under the caption of “Deferred Income.”</p>

<p>The third account, Wages, shows wages paid to June 30 of $2,125. At
that date wages earned but not yet paid, perhaps because the pay-day
did not coincide with the date of closing the books, amounted to $200.
This item is obviously an expense of the current period incurred during
the short interval between the last pay-day in June and June 30. The
adjustment is therefore made by entering $200 on the debit side of the
Wages account, to effect the <i>addition</i> of this sum to the expense
already shown there. The total amount of the account is transferred
to Profit and Loss and the account is ruled off. The amount of unpaid
wages, $200, is shown on the credit side beneath the ruling. In the
balance sheet it appears as a liability, usually under the caption of
“Accrued Expense.”</p>

<p>Similarly with the fourth account, Interest Income. Income to date
is $127.50; earned but not yet due on June 30, $17.50, showing full
earnings of $145 for the current period. This total is transferred
to Profit and Loss, the account is ruled off, and the earned but not
received portion is shown as a debit beneath the ruling, and as an
asset in the balance sheet.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised in the adjustment of all inventories to
maintain the equilibrium of the ledger by the entry of each amount to
both the debit and credit sides.</p>

<p>Besides the four illustrations given above, there are many other
accounts requiring the same kind of adjustment entries. In certain
special cases it may be necessary to make adjustments on both sides, as
for example in a general expense account or in a mixed interest account
showing both interest income and interest expense. For illustration
a mixed interest account is shown. The debit opening item of $100 in
the new section of the account represents an asset, an interest claim
against outsiders, while the credit opening item of $50 represents the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
liability to others for interest due them but not yet paid. For the
sake of accuracy and clarity, however, the better bookkeeping practice
is to keep separate accounts for Interest Income and Interest Cost.</p>

<p class="space-above1"><b>Summarizing the Ledger—The Profit and
Loss Account.</b>—After all the types of adjustments have been
made, the accounts in the ledger are restored to their fundamental
classifications, namely, assets, liabilities, and proprietorship. There
is now no intermixture of these basic elements. The proprietorship
group of accounts shows both the vested proprietorship, that is,
the capital at the beginning of the period, and the temporary
proprietorship, that is, the increases and decreases (as indicated by
the income and expense accounts) which have taken place during the
current period.</p>

<p>At the close of the fiscal period, when the temporary proprietorship
accounts have served their purpose by showing the day-to-day changes
in proprietorship and the results must be summed up, these accounts
are closed for the current period so as to keep the records separate
from those of the next period. For the purpose of summarizing the
profit and loss group of accounts, an <i>account</i> called Profit and
Loss is opened in the ledger and to it the balances of all temporary
proprietorship accounts are transferred.</p>

<p>The Profit and Loss <i>account</i> in the ledger must not be confused
with the formal <i>statement</i> of profit and loss, made up outside
the ledger just as is the balance sheet. On the credit side of Profit
and Loss will appear all credit or income account balances, and on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
debit side will appear all debit or expense account balances.
Accordingly, if the balance of the Profit and Loss account is a credit
balance, it shows a net profit for the period; if a debit balance, it
shows a net loss for the period.</p>

<p>The net profit or net loss shown by the Profit and Loss account
represents either an increase or decrease in proprietorship, and as
such is transferred to the proprietor’s personal account. As explained
in <a href="#Page_91">Chapter XII</a>, this account usually shows his
drawings during the period against these profits as they were assumed
to be accruing. The personal account thus indicates whether the amount
which he has drawn out is larger or smaller than the net profits as
determined by the Profit and Loss account. If his profits are larger
than his drawings, his capital has been increased by the amount of the
credit balance in his personal account and the transfer of this balance
to the credit side of his capital account will then show the total net
worth of the business. If his drawings are larger than the profits,
there is a decrease in capital, as shown by the debit balance of his
personal account, and the transfer of this balance to the debit side of
the capital account reduces the former capital amount.</p>

<p>The summarization of results at the close of a period is called
“closing the ledger.” The procedure consists, first, in a transfer,
i.e., in a closing out, of all the temporary proprietorship accounts
to the Profit and Loss account; second, in the transfer of the balance
of this account to the owner’s personal account; and third, in the
transfer of the balance of the personal account to the owner’s capital
account. After all temporary proprietorship accounts, the Profit and
Loss account, and the owner’s personal account have been closed, the
only accounts remaining open on the ledger are those showing either
assets, liabilities, or capital. A formal statement of the balances
of these accounts constitutes the balance sheet. The accounts through
which the income and expense records of the business are closed,
summarized, and transferred to the vested proprietorship account, are
shown below, with typical entries:

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SOURCES OF DATA FOR THE LEDGER</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Insufficiency of the Ledger Record.</b>—In an earlier chapter
a business transaction was defined as an exchange of values, and
the ledger as the book in which transactions are grouped under
predetermined titles or names. Thus, all transactions relating to
machinery are grouped under the title “Machinery”; those relating to
cash under the title of “Cash”; those to purchases under the name
“Purchases”; etc. Even in a small business the ledger may contain
a large number of accounts, all necessary to give a clear-cut
presentation of the volume and significance of business transactions.</p>

<p>The ledger record presents an analysis of transactions into their
component elements, each transaction being classified and recorded,
usually, in at least two ledger accounts, and frequently in more.
Consequently, in order to learn the nature of a given transaction, to
see it in its entirety, it may be necessary to refer to a number of
separate ledger accounts. This process, even if the ledger is small,
is not always easy; and when the ledger contains a large number of
accounts, it becomes practically impossible. Accordingly, another kind
of record is needed.</p>

<p><b>The Book of First Record.</b>—This other record shows in one place
the transaction in its entirety; it gives a complete statement of the
conditions and all other data relating to the transaction. It also
shows the fundamental analysis of the transaction into its debit and
credit elements under appropriate titles. It is called the original
or first record. Usually it is not the very first record made of the
transaction but it is the first record made in the books of account.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
The book in which this record is kept is called the “Journal.” The
record as kept in the ledger is a secondary record based on the
original or first record in the journal. Because of its secondary
nature, courts will not accept the ledger as evidence without
verification.</p>

<p><b>Posting to the Ledger.</b>—The act of transferring the original
entry from the journal into the ledger is called posting to the ledger.
In order not to lose sight of the original record in the journal it
is important that the ledger entry show by letter and number the book
and page where the original entry can be found. This index is entered
in what is called the reference column of the ledger account, which is
just to the left of the money column. In this manner every entry in a
ledger account has a reference to the original entry pertaining thereto.</p>

<p><b>The Journal.</b>—A journal may be defined as a diary or log in
which the happenings or transactions of a business are recorded
in chronological order; that is, consecutively day by day as they
arise. Formerly it was sometimes called a day-book or blotter. As
usually operated, however, the day-book or blotter contained a rough
record giving all the essential data relating to each transaction
without regard to accounting terminology, i.e., without regard to the
formulation of the debit and credit of each transaction. The day-book
entry was a sort of memorandum from which a formal record was made in
the journal. This day-book or blotter, though still in use in some
places, has very largely been discarded and only the formal journal is
used. This latter was originally a single book but in modern accounting
practice it has become separated into many special journals.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics of the Journal.</b>—1. Being of the nature of a
diary, the journal shows each day’s transactions in consecutive order
with little regard to grouping. The first characteristic, therefore, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the journal is that it is a book of chronological entry, a record of
each transaction just as it took place, with the entries made according
to the dates of the transactions.</p>

<p>2. Another characteristic of the journal entry is that it is an
analytical and classifying record. Before the entry is made, the
transaction is analyzed into its two elements of debit and credit,
determined according to the effect the transaction has in increasing
and decreasing assets, liabilities, or proprietorship. The account
titles used in the journal are the same as those used in the ledger and
are selected on the basis of a detailed subclassification of the three
fundamental groups of accounts. The degree of detail in classification
depends on the desired minuteness of the information required. The
guiding principle in giving these titles is to use such names as will
tell truthfully and accurately what kind of information is recorded
under each head. A journal entry is therefore an analytical record as
to debit and credit, which classifies the different elements of the
transaction under such titles as will later be used in the ledger.</p>

<p>3. A final and a very essential characteristic of the journal is that
every entry should carry in addition to account titles, with their
debit and credit amounts, a brief but complete summary of all the
conditions and data relating to the transaction, so that, if referred
to in the future, the journal record will call to mind the essentials
of the entire transaction.</p>

<p>Because of these three characteristics, and particularly the last two,
the journal record is of prime importance.</p>

<p><b>Equilibrium of the Journal Entry; Compound Entries.</b>—As
explained in a preceding chapter, the debit and credit elements of all
transactions must be equal in amount. Since the journal entry is an
analysis of the transaction, it must obviously show equal amounts in
the debit and credit columns. In case the analysis and classification
require an entry consisting of more than one debit and one credit
item, the total of the several debit items must equal the total of the
several credit items. Such an entry is called a compound journal entry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p class="space-below1"><b>Standard Form of Journal.</b>—The standard
form of journal provides spaces for the following information: date,
classification as to debit and credit, ledger index column, money
columns to show both the debit and credit amounts, and full record of
the essentials of the transaction. The following form illustrates a
complete journal entry:</p>

<p>The date is sometimes shown in the middle of the first blank line; but
it is better to place it at the extreme left. The account titles are
placed on separate lines unencumbered with other data, because they are
of first importance in posting. The name of the debit account is shown
on the extreme left of the explanation column, with a uniform margin
to the right for the credit account. The debit and credit amounts are
placed in the left and right money columns respectively. Data giving
full explanation of the entry are shown directly below the classified
debit and credit entry, slightly to the right of the margin of the
credit account title, and a uniform margin is maintained down the page.
The column to the left of the money columns shows the ledger pages to
which the entry is posted. The entry is read thus: Notes Receivable,
debit; James Jackson, credit, $1,000.00.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE SUBDIVISION OF THE JOURNAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Inadequacy of the Old Journal.</b>—As explained in the previous
chapter, every business transaction was formerly entered in the
journal. This necessitated the making of a formal debit and credit
entry for every item, many of which were of the same kind. As the
object of every business is to sell something, during any business
day a large number of sales, in consequence, had to be analyzed,
classified, and entered separately. The entry in each case was a credit
to Sales, and either a debit to the customer if the sale was “on time,”
or a debit to Cash if the sale was for cash. It was soon perceived
that instead of making a separate entry for each sale, one entry
could be used for bringing into the books all the sales for a given
day. This was accomplished by carrying a memorandum of the individual
transactions until the close of the day when a formal summary or
compound entry was made in the journal. Such a summary or compound
journal entry is illustrated below:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

   </tr>

</table>

<p>The memorandum of each sale was made in a blotter to record the
quantities and kind of goods sold but such entry formed no part of the
double-entry record, being merely the source of information for the
formal summary entry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p><b>The Special Journal a Labor-Saving Device.</b>—This use of the
journal can also be made in connection with other transactions,
with similar great saving of labor. Throughout the day in every
business there is a large number of cash transactions—receipts and
disbursements—which require a debit and credit record. Also purchases
of merchandise, although not numerous for any particular day, comprise
a large number of entries during the course of a month or year. To save
the labor of so many entries, the original journal is divided into
separate books known as special journals, each containing the original
entries for a particular group of similar transactions, the number of
books corresponding to the number of groups into which the various
transactions are divided.</p>

<p>For instance, where the policy of the business is to encourage the
settlement of outstanding customers’ accounts by notes, the use of a
notes receivable book or journal effects a very appreciable saving of
labor. Through the use of such a book, limited to a record of nothing
but notes receivable, it is unnecessary to write each time a note is
received, a complete journal entry as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">Notes Receivable<span class="ws4">1,500.00</span></li>
<li class="isub5">James Jackson<span class="ws6">1,500.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, the entry of Jackson’s name in the notes receivable journal
is in itself evidence of a debit to Notes Receivable account. Thus
only the credit side of the entry need be shown, with appropriate
explanation and detail, the formal debit being suppressed. When,
however, the books are closed at the end of each regular period, the
total of all these entries in the notes receivable journal is formally
labeled “Notes Receivable, Dr.” and posted to the debit of the Notes
Receivable account. This procedure brings on the ledger one debit entry
for the transactions of the entire month. The corresponding credits
have been posted in detail day by day from their journal record.</p>

<p>So also, when it is the practice of the business to issue many of its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
own notes either in payment of purchases or for discount purposes,
a “Notes Payable Journal” may be used. The method of handling this
book is similar to that of handling the notes receivable journal as
described above. A similar procedure is followed in the case of sales,
purchase, and cash transactions referred to above. The method of
handling these four groups of transactions will be explained in detail
in the chapters which follow.</p>

<p><b>Basis of Subdivisions.</b>—The basis for dividing the one general
journal into special journals is the relative frequency with which
transactions of a similar nature occur. It would evidently be of no
utility to create a special journal if the number of transactions to
be recorded in it was small, as the saving in the labor of making the
entries would be more than offset by the trouble of using an extra book.</p>

<p><b>Customary Subdivisions.</b>—The special journals most frequently
met with are those for purchases, sales, and cash. The Purchase
Journal contains the original entry of purchases, the Sales Journal
the original entry of sales, and the Cash Journals the original entry
of cash transactions. All <i>other</i> original entries are made in
the general journal. For the sake of brevity, the general journal is
usually designated by the single term “Journal.”</p>

<p>It should be thoroughly understood that no matter how many special
divisions of the journal may be in use, such books combined with the
general journal comprise the <i>journal</i> record of transactions.
None of them is merely a memorandum record to be summarized and to be
formally recorded later. The record made in each is formal, although
abbreviated, and each must be posted completely, both debit and
credit, in order to secure in the ledger a full record of all business
transactions.</p>

<p>A brief explanation will be given in following chapters of the more
simple forms of special journals.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE PURCHASE AND THE SALES<br /> JOURNALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Types of Purchase Journal.</b>—For recording purchases of
stock-in-trade, a separate special journal called “Purchase Journal”
is used. Sometimes this special journal takes the form of what is
called an “Invoice Book,” explanation of which is given in a later
chapter. The purchase journal is sometimes used to record all sorts
of purchases, as for example, purchases of store and office supplies,
of advertising and printing, and even of services such as labor, and
of uses, such as the use of a building. Such use of the journal is
more commonly made by manufacturing concerns than by mercantile houses
and the journal is then known as a “Voucher” or “Accounts Payable
Register,” which is explained in Volume II. The present discussion
is limited to the purchase journal as a record of purchases of
stock-in-trade by a mercantile firm.</p>

<p><b>Analysis of the Purchase Transaction.</b>—The debit and credit
analysis of a transaction covering a purchase of stock-in-trade may
result in either one of two groups of entries: (1) if the transaction
is on credit, a debit to Purchases and a credit to either a personal
account payable or to Notes Payable account; or (2) if the transaction
is for cash, a debit to Purchases and a credit to Cash. Whether the
purchase is on open account, on a note, or for cash, it is often
desirable to keep the accounts in such a way as not only to indicate
the vendor in each instance, but also to show the volume of business
done with each creditor. This is accomplished when the purchase is for
cash or for a note, by opening an account with the creditor in much the
same way as when it is on open account.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Thus every purchase transaction is first recorded as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(1) Purchases</li>
<li class="isub6">Vendor</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">If the purchase is a cash purchase, the liability
to the vendor is immediately canceled by the entry:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(2) Vendor</li>
<li class="isub6">Cash</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">The vendor’s account is canceled by being
credited and then immediately debited with the same amount. This
leaves on the books as the net result of these two entries a debit to
Purchases and a credit to Cash. This record of the transaction is seen
therefore to agree with the analysis of the cash purchase transaction
as previously explained.</p>

<p>Instead of opening individual accounts with each vendor, in the case
of cash purchases, the same result is sometimes accomplished by the
use of one account called “Sundry Cash Creditors.” To it all such cash
purchase transactions are posted both from purchase journal and cash
book. This method records the combined liability to all vendors in one
account. It does not, however, show the volume of business done with
each creditor.</p>

<p>If the purchase is on a note, the liability to the vendor as set up in
entry (1) is immediately canceled by the entry:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(3) Vendor</li>
<li class="isub6">Notes Payable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">The net result of these entries, (1) and (3), is
seen to be a debit to Purchases and a credit to Notes Payable—a record
which corresponds with the original analysis of the transaction.</p>

<p>Since a purchase on open account also results in a debit to Purchases
and a credit to Vendor, it is seen that all types of purchase
transactions may be recorded as a debit to Purchases and a credit to
Vendor. Accordingly, in making the current record in the purchase
journal, the debit element may be omitted, since it is always the same,
and only the credit element, which differs in each case, may be set up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Periodically, usually at the close of each month, the debit element is
formally set up for the total amount of purchases for the period. (See
<a href="#FORM_7">Form 7</a>, a typical purchase journal.) Thus the
one formal debit is made to offset the numerous credits set up during
the month. The purchase journal is thus seen to be as fully a debit
and credit journal as the general journal, even though in making its
day-to-day record the debit element is, for the sake of economy in
labor, omitted.</p>

<p>Other methods of handling the cash and note purchase transaction
are explained on <a href="#Page_152">page 152</a>.</p>

<p><b>Form and Method of Using the Purchase Journal.</b>—The simplest
form of purchase journal is the same as that of the standard journal.
It provides space for date, classification, explanation, ledger index,
and two money columns. In the purchase journal the money columns do
not have “debit” and “credit” significance, but the first may be used
for the detailed extensions and the other column for the total of each
purchase. Assume, for the sake of illustration, that the following
purchases have been made:</p>

<p>The purchase journal record, using the simple form of the standard
journal, would be as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_7" src="images/i_142a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="466" />
  <p class="f120">Form 7. Purchase Journal</p>
</div>

<p>Usually, however, a form of purchase journal is used which is better
adapted to its purpose. In this, instead of giving the detailed
explanation, the file number of the original invoice is written as
part of the explanatory matter, which usually comprises only this file
reference and the terms of the purchase. This modern type of journal is
illustrated below.</p>

  <img id="FORM_8" src="images/i_142b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="221" />
  <p class="f120">Form 8. Modern Type of Purchase Journal</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
<b>Posting the Purchase Journal.</b>—In posting the purchase journal,
it is customary to post daily the credits to the various vendor
accounts as they are entered from day-to-day in the journal. In this
way the true status of the amounts due these creditors may be known at
any time by reference to their ledger accounts. The offsetting debit
to Purchases account is posted only at the end of the month when the
purchase journal is summarized. In the meantime the ledger is out of
equilibrium because only the credit side of all purchase transactions
has been entered in the ledger. This equilibrium is restored, however,
by the monthly posting of the debit to Purchases account which must
always be made before the trial balance is taken.</p>

<p>An essential part of posting is the cross-indexing of the two records,
the journal and the ledger. The cross-reference column in the ledger
account must show the initial and page of the journal from which each
item is posted. For example, “P. 10” in the ledger would refer to
purchase journal, page 10. Likewise the ledger folio (L.F. or Folio)
column in the journal must show the ledger page of the account to which
the item has been posted. Thus, in the illustration, Stewart’s account
is on page 125 of the ledger, where he is credited with $1,250. At the
end of the month the purchase journal is footed and the summary entry,
“Purchases, Dr.,” is made and posted to the debit of Purchases account
on page 10 of the ledger. This one debit item in the ledger brings
about the equilibrium with the individual credits posted to the various
personal accounts payable. The purchase journal is then ruled off and
thus made ready for new entries for the next month immediately below
the rulings.</p>

<p><b>Departmental Analysis of Purchases.</b>—When it is desirable to
separate various classes of purchases so as to determine the profit
from each class, particularly in a business which is departmentized,
a purchase journal similar to the one shown in <a href="#FORM_9">Form 9</a>, which
has an additional money column for each class of purchases, may be used. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
there are three classes or departments, at least four money columns
are required. The entry in the first column is for the total amount of
the purchases; and the entries in the other three columns, which are
headed each with the name of a class or department, are for the total
purchases of the respective departments. It is evident that the totals
of these three columns, added together, must at all times be equal to
the total of the first column. This affords a check on the accuracy of
the distribution. At posting time a separate account is opened in the
ledger corresponding to each of these classes of purchases. The summary
entry in a purchase journal of this kind appears as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_9" src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="309" />
  <p class="f120">Form 9. Departmental Purchase Journal</p>
</div>

<p>Purchases are classified under separate titles, usually because it is
desirable to make a corresponding classification of sales and so secure
departmental results of operation.</p>

<p><b>The Sales Journal—Analysis of the Sales Transaction and Method of
Record.</b>—For recording sales of stock-in-trade, a record called the
“Sales Journal” is used, which is limited to sales of merchandise. A
sales journal practically identical in form with the purchase journal
serves this purpose. Its columns are ruled and current entries are made
in it just as in the purchase journal.</p>

<p>The analysis of a sales transaction shows a credit to Sales and a debit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
either to Customer, Cash, or Notes Receivable, according as the sale
is “on time,” for cash, or against a note given by the customer. In
handling cash sales and sales against the customer’s note, the same
procedure is followed as with purchases, i.e., accounts with customers
are opened for <i>all</i> sales, and are immediately closed off if cash
or a note is received at the time of the sale.</p>

<p>The current entry in the sales journal shows only the debit item, i.e.,
the charge to the customer’s account, the credit to Sales account being
omitted. At the end of the month, however, the total of all sales is
indicated by the summary entry and is posted to the credit side of the
Sales account in the ledger. In order to keep the customers’ accounts
up to date, the current entries in the sales book, giving the names
of the customers and the amounts, are transferred to the customers’
accounts in the ledger at the close of each day.</p>

<p><b>Summarization of the Sales Journal.</b>—At the end of the month
or other posting time, the sales journal is totaled and the summary
entry is made and posted, thus bringing the ledger into equilibrium by
one credit to Sales account for the sum of all the debits to customers
accounts made day by day. The closing rulings are then made. The
treatment is exactly similar to the work in the purchase journal, the
only difference being in the summary entry, where “Sales, Cr.” takes
the place of “Purchases, Dr.” If it is desired to keep the sales record
by departments or classes of commodities, analysis columns will effect
the distribution. In this type of sales record the closing summary
indicates the various departmental or other sales accounts to which
postings are to be made, instead of the one general account, Sales,
precisely as the departmental purchase journal (<a href="#FORM_9">Form 9</a>)
indicates the departmental or other purchases accounts to which
purchase entries are to be posted.</p>

<p><b>Goods Sold to the Owner.</b>—The treatment of goods sold to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
owner of the business requires brief consideration. The proprietor
usually withdraws goods at cost price. There is thus no element of
profit in the transaction as there is in other sales. A strict analysis
of the transaction shows that it brings about only a decrease of the
asset unmixed with any element of income. Theoretically, then, such
transactions should not be recorded with the regular sales, but should
be shown as a credit to Purchases account. In practice, however,
entering them in the sales journal is the easiest method of recording
them, and since they are not usually large in volume, this method
does not vitiate the total sales figure as a basis for estimating
percentages of profit. This matter is discussed in detail on
<a href="#Page_273">page 273</a>.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE CASH JOURNALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Cash Book.</b>—For recording transactions involving cash,
two journals are used. One of these records receipts and the other
disbursements of cash. They are known respectively as the “Cash
Receipts Journal” and the “Cash Disbursements Journal.” Instead of
being separate books, however, they are usually bound together and
comprise what is called the “Cash Book.” When bound together their
pages alternate throughout the book. The cash receipts journal
occupies the left-hand pages, i.e., the even numbered pages—2, 4, 6,
etc.—and the cash disbursements journal the right-hand pages—3, 5,
7, etc.— page 1 not being used. This method sets up the cash record,
receipts and disbursements, on facing pages and the movement of cash
is thus under easy and constant review.</p>

<p><b>The Cash Receipts Journal—Analysis of a Cash Receipt.</b>—If $100
cash is received on account from John Doe, a customer, an analysis of
the transaction shows “Cash” debit and “John Doe” credit.</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">Cash<span class="ws4">100.00</span></li>
<li class="isub4">John Doe<span class="ws4">100.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p>So with all receipts of cash; the “cash” element is a debit. The
record of cash receipts being made in a journal devoted exclusively to
receipts of cash, the “Cash, Dr.” element of the entry may be omitted
and only the “credit” element need be shown; the very fact that the
entry is made in the cash receipts journal is sufficient to indicate
that “Cash” is a debit. The cash receipts journal (<a href="#FORM_10">Form 10</a>)—the
left or debit side of the cash book—is operated, therefore very much like
the purchase journal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_10" src="images/i_148.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="325" />
  <p class="f120">Form 10. Cash Book (left-hand page)<br /> (Cash Receipts Journal)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Cash Disbursements Journal—Analysis of a Cash
Disbursement.</b>—If $10 is paid for expenses of some kind, the
analysis gives “Expense” debit and “Cash” credit.</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">Expense<span class="ws3">10.00</span></li>
<li class="isub5">Cash<span class="ws4">10.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">So with all disbursements of cash. A separate
journal being devoted exclusively to cash disbursements, the “Cash,
Cr.” element of the entry may be omitted and only the debit shown. The
cash disbursements journal is thus seen to be operated in the same way
as the sales journal.</p>

<p>Thus, all left-hand pages in the cash book show receipts and all
right-hand pages show disbursements. Because it is unnecessary to
<i>write</i> the debit element of cash received and the credit element
of cash paid out, a great saving of labor is effected. Nevertheless, it
must be remembered that the entry on either side of the cash book is
essentially a journal entry, and that the missing elements—cash debit
on the left page and cash credit on the right page—are supplied at the
end of the period by the totals when the two journals are summarized in
preparation for posting to the Cash account in the ledger.

  <p class="f120">Form 11. Cash Book (right-hand page)<br />
                   (Cash Disbursements Journal)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Form of the Cash Journals.</b>—In the cash journals, just as in all
other journals, provision is made for date, account classification,
explanation, ledger posting index, and money columns. In a simple form
of cash book, just as in the purchase and sales journals, two money
columns are usually provided, the one for detail—a day’s or week’s
detail—and the other for totals. Such a form is shown in Forms 10 and
11. The student should note carefully how the cash receipts journal
is summarized. The balance of cash brought forward from the previous
week is entered in the second or total column so that the detail column
shows only the current week’s receipts. Inasmuch as the Cash account in
the ledger already shows the balance of cash at the beginning of the
week, i.e., $5,000, this amount must not be included in the summary
entry for the current week. In summarizing the cash receipts journal,
therefore, the total only of the detail column, showing the cash
received since the last summary, is set up as a “Cash, Dr.” item. In
summarizing the cash disbursements journal, since there is normally
no balance carried over from the previous week, the total of the
journal—representing the cash disbursed since the last summary—is
set up as a “Cash, Cr.” item. This is shown as $365, the amount being
posted to the credit of the ledger Cash account on page 1.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p><b>Cash Book Taking the Place of the Cash Account.</b>—Because the
two cash journals are set up on facing pages, the record contains
essentially the same information as a detailed Cash account in the
ledger. The double page record brings together both the receipts and
the deductions from receipts—cash being normally a debit account. For
this reason the cash book record is itself sometimes used as a ledger
account and when it is so used its totals are not posted to the ledger
account. The balance of the cash book must, however, be included in the
trial balance of the ledger, because when so used the cash book is not
only a <i>journal</i> but a <i>ledger account</i> as well.</p>

<p>When, however, the totals of both cash receipts and disbursements are
posted to a Cash account in the ledger, the balance used in the trial
balance is taken from the ledger account and not from the cash book,
although of course the balances in both are the same.</p>

<p>Whichever of these two methods is used, it must always be remembered
that the cash book is essentially a journal and that therefore its
classifications of business transactions must be transferred to their
proper accounts in the ledger.</p>

<p>Best accounting practice, however, requires that a Cash account be
carried in the ledger so that the ledger will be a complete record of
all transactions and will be independent of all other records for proof
of its equilibrium.</p>

<p><b>Posting the Cash Book.</b>—In posting the debit side of the cash
book to the ledger, it is important to remember that the debit element
of the transaction is merely indicated by the fact that the entry
appears on the left-hand page of the cash book. The account name
written in the Account Classification column is the credit element
and must be posted to the credit of the corresponding account in the
ledger. Similarly, on the right-hand side of the cash book, the cash
credit element of the entry is suppressed and the named account should
be posted to the debit of the corresponding ledger account.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>After the posting of the individual items has been completed, the
“Cash, Dr.” and the “Cash, Cr.” as shown by the summary entries must be
posted to the ledger Cash account, as explained on <a href="#Page_143">page 143</a>.</p>

<p>As stated above, each side of the cash book is, in reality, a
journal in itself—a cash receipts journal and a cash disbursements
journal—and it is only because these two journals are shown side by
side that the cash book is sometimes made to serve the purpose of a
ledger Cash account.</p>

<p><b>Balancing and Ruling the Cash Book.</b>—The cash book in its simple
form is balanced and ruled in the same manner as a ledger account. When
the balance is brought down to the new section it is usually entered in
the second or total column, thus reserving the first or detail column
for the daily or weekly cash receipts, and separating these items from
the balance brought down from the previous period. (See Forms 10 and 11.)</p>

<p>When the record is to be transferred to a new page, either the current
page (double page) is balanced and ruled and only the balance is
carried forward, or the current page is totaled and both debit and
credit footings are carried forward as shown in <a href="#Page_106">Chapter XIV</a>
for the ledger cash account. The cash book is closed, ruled, and
transferred as of the same date and on the same line for both sides,
although usually there is room for more entries on one side or the
other, which may be closed by diagonal ruling. This is done in order
to keep the record of the receipts of a given period and that of the
disbursements in nearly exact juxtaposition, and thereby facilitate a
review of the cash movements for that period.</p>

<p><b>The Cash Short and Over Account.</b>—It sometimes happens that
when the cash book is balanced, the amount which ought to be on hand
as shown by this balance, does not agree with the amount of cash on
hand as shown by actual count. The discrepancy may be due to failure to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
enter some items of receipts or disbursements in the cash book, or to
errors in making change; or it may be due to petty thieving by the cash
clerk. If the error cannot be rectified at the time, an entry is made
in the cash book, on whichever side necessary, in an amount sufficient
to bring the book balance into agreement with the actual cash balance.
The account to be debited or credited, as the case may be, is entitled
“Cash Short and Over.” If the correct charge or credit is afterwards
determined, the item or items should be transferred from Cash Short and
Over to their proper accounts. Usually the Cash Short and Over account
is treated as an income or expense account and closed into Profit and
Loss at the close of the period. Sometimes it is treated as an asset or
liability account, depending upon the nature of its contents, i.e., the
amount of the discrepancy shown and its probable cause.</p>

<p><b>The Cash Purchase and Sales Transactions.</b>—A standard method of
handling the cash purchase transaction when it is desired to keep a
record of the volume of business done with each vendor, was explained
on <a href="#Page_140">page 140</a>, where the purchase was shown to be
“washed” or cleared through the vendor’s account. A more direct method
is sometimes used.</p>

<p>When purchases are made for cash, a complete record of the transactions
is made by the entry:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">Purchases</li>
<li class="isub5">Cash</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">Here there is evidently a conflict of places of original
record. The transaction being a purchase, record should be made in the purchase
journal; and since it is also a cash transaction, record should also
be made in the cash book. However, if an independent record were made
in both places, a duplication of the transaction would result, since
entry in either journal is a complete debit and credit record. The
transaction would be entered twice in full, causing an inflation of the
purchases and cash disbursements. In the purchase journal, the credit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
to Cash would be set up at the time of the transaction and at the time
of summarization the debit to Purchases would be included in the total
of the Purchases, thus completing the ledger record. In the cash book
the debit to Purchases would be set up at the time of the transaction,
and when the summary was made the credit to Cash would be in the Cash
total. Entry in both journals would, when posted to the ledger, bring
about two debits and two credits for the same transaction.</p>

<p>To overcome this difficulty the following methods are commonly employed:</p>

<p>1. The record is made complete in both journals, but the credit to
Cash from the purchase journal record is not posted, because that
credit will be posted from its record in the cash book. Similarly,
when posting the cash disbursements journal, the debit to Purchases
is <i>not</i> posted, because that will be posted from the purchase
journal. In this way original record may be made in both journals and
each journal will then show by its total what it is intended to show,
viz., total purchases and total cash disbursed, respectively. In the
secondary record, the ledger, only half of each journal entry is set
up, the debit to Purchases from the purchase journal and the credit to
Cash from the cash book. This prevents the inflation mentioned above
and does not destroy the equilibrium of the ledger because there is
omitted, when posting from the cash book, a debit equal in amount to
the credit omitted when posting the purchase journal.</p>

<p>2. The method explained on <a href="#Page_140">page 140</a> is used
with this variation: The record in each journal shows the individual
vendor’s account, but at posting time no vendor account is set up
in the ledger, neither the credit to the vendor’s account shown in
the purchase journal nor its offsetting debit shown in the cash
disbursements journal being posted.</p>

<p>It is necessary, when making the original entries in the journals, to
indicate all postings which are to be omitted, by entering a check
mark, ✔, or a cross, ❌, in the ledger folio column of the journal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>The purchase on a note payable, one method of recording which was
explained on <a href="#Page_140">page 140</a>, may also be handled more
directly by either of the methods explained above for a cash purchase.
In the case of the note, however, the journals used are the purchase
and general journals.</p>

<p>Similar methods are employed, also, for handling the cash sale and the
sale against a customer’s note.</p>

<p><b>Columnar Analysis of Cash Receipts and Disbursements.</b>—As
illustrated in the chapters on purchase and sales journals, additional
money columns are often used for the purpose of analyzing the purchases
and sales by departments or classes of commodities. A similar analysis
of both the cash receipts and cash disbursements may aid in segregating
certain classes of cash items and thus save labor in posting. Of cash
receipts, two classes are usually more active than all others combined.
More cash is received from cash sales and from customers on account
than from any other source. Accordingly, two additional columns may be
used with these headings. <i>All</i> cash receipts must be entered in
the Total, Bank, or Net Cash column, as it is variously termed, and
then distributed into any special columns provided. Thus all “Cash
Sales” would be extended, both in the Net Cash and in the Sales column,
and all receipts from customers would be entered in the Net Cash and in
the Accounts Receivable column.</p>

<p>In the case of cash disbursements, the number of columns depends upon
the degree of analysis desired. At least two additional columns are
frequently found, one for creditors and one for expenses. Where cash
purchases are numerous they may be segregated, or where any particular
<i>class</i> of expense is of frequent occurrence it may be shown in
a separate column. Where one ledger is used for customers, creditors,
and general accounts, there is little gain in segregating customers and
creditors by special columns in the cash book, except as a slight aid
in posting. Where separate ledgers are used, it is important to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
separate customers and creditors columns in the cash book, as will be
shown later in connection with the subject of controlling accounts.
Illustration and explanation of the columnar cash book are given on
<a href="#Page_158">pages 158 and 159</a>.</p>

<p><b>Cash Discounts Analyzed.</b>—Sales and purchase discounts are
another class of transactions best handled through the cash book,
although, strictly speaking, they are not cash transactions. When
a customer buys goods on account, he is usually offered two bases
of settlement, depending on the length of the credit term allowed.
Thus, 2% off is frequently allowed if payment is made within 10 days;
otherwise the full amount of the invoice must be paid. Because the
vendor does not know, at the time of entry on his books, on which basis
settlement will be made, he makes the charge at the full invoiced
amount. If the customer takes advantage of the discount offered, he
pays less than the amount at which his account stands debited, yet the
vendor must credit his account for the full amount of the original
charge, in order to cancel his entire claim against the customer. To
illustrate, a customer buys $100 worth of merchandise, with 2% off if
paid within 10 days. On the 10th day he pays $98. The sale entry would be:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(1) Customer<span class="ws4">100.00</span></li>
<li class="isub5">Sales<span class="ws7">100.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">The cash entry would be:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(2) Cash<span class="ws6">98.00</span></li>
<li class="isub4">Customer<span class="ws6">98.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">But this does not cancel in full the $100 claim
against the customer. The $2 discount, an allowance for early payment,
is an expense to the business and must be charged to an expense account
called “Sales Discount,” and the customer must be given $2 additional
credit, the entry being:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(3) Sales Discount<span class="ws4">2.00</span></li>
<li class="isub6">Customer<span class="ws6">2.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Entries (2) and (3) are usually combined in one as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">(4)  Cash<span class="ws7">98.00</span></li>
<li class="isub4">Sales Discount<span class="ws3">2.00</span></li>
<li class="isub6">Customer<span class="ws5">100.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">Entry (4) is known as a compound entry. If entry
(2), which is the part involving cash, is made in the cash book, then
the additional entry (3) will have to be made in the general journal
because there is no cash element in it and theoretically nothing but
cash should be recorded in the cash book.</p>

<p><b>Handling Discounts in the Cash Book.</b>—This recording in two
separate places of what is really one transaction has led to the
introduction into the cash book of a non-cash column in order to bring
the whole transaction together. The customer’s payment being a receipt
of cash, the record must be made on the debit side of the cash book.
Reference to entry (4) shows that Sales Discount is also a “debit.”
Where the cash book is limited strictly to cash transactions, the cash
debit record shows only the “credit” element of the entry. The use of a
Sales Discount column on the debit side of the cash book for the sake
of making a complete record in one place thus introduces an extraneous
element, one out of harmony with the other entries made there. In
posting, great care must be exercised not to transfer Sales Discount to
the credit side of its ledger account but to the <i>debit</i> side.</p>

<p><b>Alternative Treatment for Cash Discounts.</b>—Sometimes another
treatment of sales and purchase discounts in the cash book is met with.
This treatment for sales discount is based on the fiction that the full
amount of the original charge is received from the customer and that an
immediate return is made to him of the amount of the discount. To use
the example cited on <a href="#Page_155">page 155</a>, the entries would be:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">Cash<span class="ws6">100.00</span></li>
<li class="isub3">Customer<span class="ws6">100.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
showing receipt of the full invoice price and therefore full credit to
the customer; and</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_120">
<li class="isub2">Sales Discount<span class="ws6">2.00</span></li>
<li class="isub7">Cash<span class="ws7">2.00</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">representing the fictitious payment in cash of
a discount on sales of $2. In the cash book these two entries would
appear as follows:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl bb2">Dr.</td>
      <td class="tdl bb2"><span class="smcap">Cash</span><span class="ws4"> </span></td>
      <td class="tdc">  </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1 bb2"><span class="ws4"><span class="smcap">Cash</span></span></td>
      <td class="tdr bb2">Cr.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">Customer</td>
      <td class="tdr"><span class="ws4">100.00</span></td>
      <td class="tdc"> </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">Sales Discount</td>
      <td class="tdr"><span class="ws4">2.00</span></td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="5"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>This method of entering discount on sales would have the same ultimate
result in the ledger as the columnar method, but the objection to it
is that it makes the cash book show more money received and paid out
than has actually been the case, thus making it difficult to check the
cash against the bank record of deposits and checks. Another objection
is that by this method the cash book does not show in one place a full
record of the transaction, since the two items are shown on opposite
sides of the cash book. Moreover, these items are seldom on contiguous
lines because one side of the cash book is often considerably “ahead”
of the other. Cash discount on purchases is sometimes handled by a
similar unsatisfactory method.</p>

<p>The first method shown, requiring special discount and net columns
on either side of the cash book, is the approved method.</p>

<p><b>Illustration and Explanation of the Analytic Cash Receipts
Journal.</b>—An example of a columnar cash book debit side is
given (<a href="#FORM_12">Form 12</a>) for the purpose of illustrating
some points in the discussion. It should be understood that there is
little uniformity in the columnization of cash books. The needs of the
business govern the ruling suitable in any given case. The illustration
shown is therefore not presented as a standard form but is given only
for the purpose of illustrating the method of analysis of cash receipts.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
As shown in the illustration, all <i>actual cash receipts</i> are
entered in the Net Cash column, which in connection with the Sales
Discount column comprises the total corresponding to the Total column
of the other subsidiary journals when an analytic record is made. All
items received from customers are entered in the Accounts Receivable
column; but it is important to note that the <i>amount</i> entered
in that column is not the <i>actual cash receipt</i> but the <i>full
amount</i> of the original charge to the customer. Sales discount,
if any, is entered in the Sales Discount column, and the <i>net</i>
amount, the actual cash received from the customer, is the amount
appearing in the Net Cash column. Cash sales are entered in the Cash
Sales column and also in the Net Cash column. All other kinds of
receipts are extended to the Sundry column.</p>

<p>In the ledger folio column, checks are placed for the individual
cash sales entries, the posting usually being made from the summary
in the sales journal, as explained a little later, or from the total
of the Cash Sales column in the cash book if the other method is not
employed. In the summary entry of the illustration, it is assumed
that a Cash account is kept in the ledger. Hence “Cash, Dr.” is shown
posted to ledger Cash account on page 4; and the total Sales Discount,
also <i>debit</i>, on page 20. The student should note the method of
showing the amount of cash received during the current week, this
amount comprising the “Cash, Dr.” posting to the ledger Cash account.
Of course, the itemized credits, except the cash sales, are posted to
their respective accounts, as indicated in the ledger folio column.</p>

<p>The use of the Sundry column for extension of the miscellaneous items
makes proof of the distribution possible. The sum of “Net Cash” and
“Sales Discounts”—both debit items—must equal the sum of all the
other columns.</p>

<p><b>Handling Columnar Analysis of Cash Sales.</b>—If all sales, both
cash and “on time,” are entered in the sales journal, the totals of
these two classes of sales are posted to the ledger Sales account from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the summary in the sales journal. In this case there is no need of a
separate Cash Sales column in the cash book, because such a column
would simply duplicate the Cash Sales entry in the sales journal.
Needless to say, cash sales always appear in the Net Cash column of the
cash book, because they are cash receipts, but the “Ledger Folio” must
be checked.</p>

<p>Sometimes two sales accounts are kept in the ledger, one for cash and
the other for “time” sales. Here, also, if there is a Cash Sales column
in the sales journal, no posting of cash sales from the cash book is
necessary. On the other hand, if cash sales are omitted from the sales
journal, then the cash book should provide for a Cash Sales column and
the posting must be made from the total of this column in the cash book.</p>

<p><b>Illustration and Explanation of the Analytic Cash Disbursements
Journal.</b>—The cash disbursements columnar record corresponding to
the cash receipts shown above, would appear as in <a href="#FORM_13">Form 13</a>.
As with cash receipts, the illustration is not presented as a
standardized form but merely for the purpose of showing the method of
analysis. Postings are made or omitted, and the same considerations
govern the making and posting of the summary entry, as in cash
receipts. Being few in number, cash purchases are not shown in a
separate column. The treatment of discounts received on purchases is
exactly parallel to that of sales discount.</p>

<p>Since all net cash appears in Net Cash column on either side of the
cash book, the cash balance is found by taking the difference between
these two columns. The two sides must be ruled up and closed on
corresponding lines and as of the same date.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE MODERN JOURNAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Matter Left for Record in the Journal.</b>—By the use of a cash
receipts, a cash disbursements, a purchase, and a sales journal,
four principal classes of transactions are taken out of the old-time
journal and entered in separate books of record. If transactions of
any other class are numerous enough to justify the use of a separate
book of record, such a record should be set up. Although the number of
subsidiary journals, each recording one kind of transaction, may become
very large, nevertheless in practically all cases it is necessary to
retain the general journal (often referred to simply as “the Journal”),
in order to take care of such miscellaneous items as are not recorded
in any of the special journals.</p>

<p>The standard form of journal was illustrated in <a href="#Page_132">Chapter XVI</a>,
where it was stated that a journal must provide space for date of
entry, account classification, ledger folio index, debit and credit
money columns, and explanation. As an explanation of the form, method
of use, proper observance of margins, etc., was made there, it need not
be repeated here.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Transactions Recorded in the Journal.</b>—When the number
of subsidiary journals used is limited to the cash receipts, cash
disbursements, purchase, and sales journals, as is frequently the
case, all items not affecting these four books should be entered in
“the Journal”; i.e., transactions involving notes receivable and notes
payable; adjustments with customers and creditors resulting from return
of goods or claims and allowances thereon; and all formal opening,
adjusting, and closing entries. Furthermore, there is usually a number
of other transactions, which because of their special and unusual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
nature cannot be grouped with the items of the special journals and
must therefore be entered in the general journal.</p>

<p><b>Journal Explanations.</b>—When these various classes of
transactions are entered in the Journal, a very complete explanation
should be given the entry. In fact, all entries covering settlements
and adjustments with outsiders and within the business itself are of
primary importance and the explanation should be so carefully worded as
to make the intent of the entry plain and intelligible.</p>

<p><b>Closing and Posting the Journal.</b>—No particular formality
attaches to the closing and posting of the ordinary standard form of
journal. There is no summary entry, no totaling, and there are no
rulings to be made. Ordinary care must be exercised to see that the
debits and credits are correctly posted. Since the entry in the Journal
is given in its complete form and no debits or credits are suppressed,
as is the case in the special journals, posting is not difficult.</p>

<p><b>The Analytic Journal with Divided Columns.</b>—One form of the
journal has its debit and credit columns separated, the debit money
column appearing at the extreme left of the page, followed in order
across the page by columns for date, account classification, ledger
folio, and credit money amount. This kind of journal is called a
divided or split-column journal and is ordinarily used to collect the
totals to be posted to controlling accounts and thus to secure control
over subsidiary ledgers. This matter will be fully discussed in later
chapters. When the journal is so used it is provided with additional
debit and credit analysis columns on each side according to the
subsidiary ledgers employed. A divided-column journal with three debit
and three credit columns is shown in <a href="#FORM_14">Form 14</a>.
There is always a general money column on each side, the other columns
depending on the kind of analysis required by the business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="f120">Form 14. Divided Column Journal</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
In the illustration referred to, an Accounts Receivable and an Accounts
Payable column are provided. It is obvious that the Accounts Receivable
column should usually appear on the credit side and the Accounts
Payable column on the debit side; although in some cases provision
is also made for an Accounts Receivable column on the debit and an
Accounts Payable column on the credit side. The account of S. J. White,
a customer, which is paid by his note, should be credited for the
amount of $510.20 and consequently the item is extended to the Accounts
Receivable column.</p>

<p><b>Illustrations—Opening Entries.</b>—Illustration will be given
of a few typical transactions requiring journal entry. The standard
two-column journal will be used.</p>

<p>For the purpose of illustrating opening entries, assume the following
data:</p>

<p class="blockquot">On September 30, 19—, Jack Gibson started in
business, with the following assets and liabilities: Cash $3,500; Notes
Receivable $800; Merchandise $4,000; Furniture and Fixtures $450;
Accounts Receivable $2,100; Accounts Payable $1,500; and Notes Payable
$1,200.</p>

<p>An analysis of this transaction shows that no part of it belongs to
either the purchase or sales journals. The part relating to cash is
entered in the cash receipts journal. However, in order to show the
complete investment in one place, the entire transaction including the
cash part, is entered in the Journal and posted from there, with the
exception of the cash item. The reason for this exception is that the
cash investment is also entered in the cash book and will find its way
to the ledger Cash account through the total cash debits at the end of
the period. Because of this the cash item in the <i>Journal</i> should
be checked and not posted to the Cash account in the ledger.</p>

<p>Likewise, the investment item in the <i>cash book</i>, showing a credit
of $3,500 to Jack Gibson, Capital account, should be checked and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
posted to the credit of his account in the ledger because this item
forms a part of the total investment of $8,150 posted to his credit
from the Journal entry.</p>

<p>If the student has difficulty in determining the debits and credits of
entries of this kind, it may be helpful to set up the data informally
first, in the form of a balance sheet. Using this as a <i>guide</i>,
he should then make his journal entry, debiting the asset items and
crediting the liability and net worth items.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="f120">Form 15. Opening Entries on Books</p>
</div>

<p>The above entries bring the transaction completely on the books of
original entry and show the ledger folios to which the various items
are posted. Notice the check in the L. F. column in the Journal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
opposite “Cash” and in the cash book opposite “Jack Gibson, Capital,”
which is inserted to prevent posting the same item twice.</p>

<p>For opening entries full explanation and details, where necessary,
should be given in the Journal, covering lease agreements and contracts
entered into when commencing business, and other similar data. It
should be noted that with <i>opening</i> entries it is customary for
the explanation to precede the formal showing of debits and credits,
rather than to follow it as in the case of all other journal entries.</p>

<p><b>Adjusting and Closing Entries.</b>—Other typical entries to be
illustrated are those made at the close of a fiscal period: (1)
to adjust the books in accordance with certain data that were not
obtainable before; (2) to transfer all temporary proprietorship
accounts to the summary account, Profit and Loss; and (3) to transfer
the net profit, i.e., the balance of the Profit and Loss account, to
the proprietor’s personal account, and the balance of this latter
account to the proprietor’s capital account.</p>

<p>The debits and credits of the entries necessary to effect the record
of the data and transfers mentioned, can be determined as in the
operations with ledger accounts previously shown.</p>

<p>The following data relate to Jack Gibson’s business and are given to
illustrate the three classes of entries mentioned above:</p>

<p class="blockquot">During the year, sales amounted to $33,000;
purchases to $25,000; selling expenses to $3,500; and general
administrative expenses to $2,025. It is estimated that of outstanding
accounts $350 are uncollectible; that furniture and fixtures have
depreciated in value $45. Merchandise inventory shows $5,000 on hand.
Gibson drew $1,000 during the year.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary is to make the adjustments on account
of depreciation, bad debts estimate, and present inventory. These
adjustment entries are made in the Journal as follows:

<p>The first two entries, when posted, will bring on the book valuation
accounts for furniture and fixtures and accounts receivable, and will
set up the expense accounts, Depreciation and Bad Debts. The third
Journal entry, when posted, will transfer the goods on hand at the
beginning of the year so that they can be added to the Purchases made
during the year. In this connection it will be remembered that the
sum of these two items, old inventory plus purchases during the year,
constitutes the primary factor of “cost of goods to be accounted for.”
The fourth entry shows the asset Merchandise now on hand and, by its
credit to Purchases, effects a subtraction from Purchases, so that the
balance of Purchases, $24,000, shows the “cost of goods sold.”</p>

<p>The books are now adjusted and ready for summarization by means of the
Profit and Loss account. The following Journal entries, transferring
all temporary proprietorship items to the Profit and Loss account, will
effect the closing operation:

<p>The first entry transfers the sales income to the credit of Profit and
Loss. The second entry charges the Profit and Loss account with the
cost of goods sold and all other expenses for the fiscal year. When
the posting has been completed up to this point, the balance of the
Profit and Loss account shows a net gain of $3,080, which, belonging to
the proprietor, is transferred to the credit of his personal account,
as shown by the third entry. He has drawn against prospective profits
to the extent of $1,000, leaving $2,080 of profit remaining in the
business as an addition to his permanent investment. Hence, this
balance is transferred to Gibson’s capital account by the fourth entry.</p>

<p><b>Objection to the Direct Ledger Method of Adjusting and Closing the
Books.</b>—These adjustment and closing transactions are sometimes
recorded directly in the ledger without first entering them in the
Journal. Usually this is not satisfactory because it does not show in
one place a complete record of all the adjustment and closing summaries
necessary at the close of a fiscal period. These summaries are matters
of sufficient concern to the business to warrant their entry in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Journal where full and complete explanations can be given. The more
complex entries often needed to adjust and close the books of a
business where numerous income and expense accounts are kept, follow
the same general principles as those discussed above. Adjusting and
closing entries are given fuller treatment in Chapters <a href="#Page_221">XXVII</a>
and <a href="#Page_237">XXVIII</a>.</p>

<p>The two illustrations given above cover certain types of Journal
entries which are of a more difficult character than the customary
purchases, sales, and cash entries. A keen analysis is often required
to formulate the debits and credits of these entries, and the
explanatory matter should be worded with sufficient care to render them
intelligible even after the immediate interest in them has been lost
and their recording ink has become “cold.”</p>

<p><b>Entries Affecting Several Journals.</b>—Transactions sometimes
require entry in two or more journals. A basic principle of bookkeeping
is that there should be no duplication of entry in the various
journals. A transaction that can be completely entered in one journal
should not be entered in any other journal. The one exception to
this principle is made in the case of an investment transaction, as
explained on <a href="#Page_171">page 171</a>. Sometimes, however,
there may be a conflict of places of entry, as in the case of cash
purchases and sales, already explained, where entry is made in both
journals in order to allow each journal to perform its proper function.
Two examples will illustrate the proper method of handling such
transactions.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b><span class="smcap">Problem 1.</span></b> Assume

neither having any special advantage over the other.</p>

<p class="no-indent space-above2">Entry (a) is made in the cash
disbursements journal, and entry (b) in the general journal. This
method of entry requires the splitting of the land value into two parts
and breaks up what is really a unit transaction by recording it in
two places. Because of this, the general journal portion of the entry
should be followed by a very full explanation of the <i>entire</i>
transaction, in which reference to the partial cash payment should be
made. In the cash disbursements journal the only explanation needed
will be a reference to the general journal entry.</p>

Entry (a) in the general journal sets up an account with the vendor,
the Investment Trust Co. Entry (b) in the cash disbursements journal

liability to the vendor through the payment of cash in the one case and
the giving of a mortgage in the other. The net effect of the entries is:</p>

<p>It will be noted that this method sets up a formal account with the
vendor—a desirable thing—but that it requires one more entry than the
first method.</p>

<p>The other entries recorded in the Journal ought not to give the
student any particular difficulty.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">BUSINESS PAPERS—NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The books of original entry, i.e., the journals, having been explained,
the attention of the student will be directed next to the sources
of information on which the entries in the various journals depend.
Accordingly, some of the important papers and methods used in business
will be discussed, after which further accounting principles and
methods will be given adequate treatment.</p>

<p><b>Use of the Note Receivable.</b>—The purpose of sales is the
ultimate conversion of stock-in-trade into cash to provide for the
payment of services and for the purchase of commodities for future
sale. This conversion of stock-in-trade into money may be immediate,
as when goods are sold for cash, or deferred, as when goods are sold
on account. In the latter case the conversion is indirect, because the
charge against the customer must be collected before conversion is complete.</p>

<p>Frequently the “note receivable” acts as an intermediate step in the
process of converting stock-in-trade into cash. It is an instrument in
which the customer formally promises to pay his debt at a fixed time
in the future. The kind of claim represented by a note receivable is,
legally, different from the open account claim; generally speaking,
a note is considered <i>a better</i> claim than an open account.
This is because the note implies a prima facie acknowledgment of the
correctness of the original charge, and in event of suit relieves the
holder from proving the original items of the claim.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when a promissory note is received from a customer, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
open account claim against him ceases to exist and a different kind of
claim evidenced by his promissory note is acquired. Therefore the open
account is credited to show cancellation of the original charge, and
Notes Receivable is debited to show the new claim. It may be well to
remark here that the same instrument which is a <i>note receivable</i>
to the vendor is a <i>note payable</i> to the customer.</p>

<p>In some businesses, it is the policy to encourage customers to give
notes. In such cases it is often advantageous, particularly for the
credit information shown, to set up the note transactions with each
customer under individual names, e.g., “John Doe, Notes Receivable.”
Such a title plainly indicates the nature of the items listed under it;
viz., claims against John Doe, witnessed by his promissory notes. As a
general rule, however, the notes received from any one customer or all
customers are usually relatively small in number and for this reason
they are for the most part brought together under one class title,
Notes Receivable.</p>

<p><b>Negotiable Instruments—Their Use and Requisites.</b>—Notes
receivable belong to a class of business papers termed negotiable
instruments, the distinctive feature of which is that in many ways and
for many purposes they <i>take the place of money</i>. The negotiable
instrument, usually of small size but often representing a large sum
of money, is used in the commerce of the world as a <i>medium of
exchange</i>, in place of heavy and bulky coin or valuable bank notes
which when lost or stolen can be passed as currency.</p>

<p>From a legal standpoint a negotiable instrument is one which gives a
bona fide holder an absolute right to it, whether the preceding holder
had acquired it lawfully or not. It is in this respect distinguished
from other objects of value, as a horse, for example, the present
possessor of which is the legal owner only if he acquired it in good
faith from one who in turn had acquired it lawfully.</p>

<p>To be negotiable, an instrument must have the following requisites:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. It must be in writing and signed by the maker
or drawer.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. It must contain an unconditional promise or
order to pay a fixed sum of money—and the payment must be made in legal
tender.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. It must be payable on demand or at a time
which is either fixed or can be determined.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. It must be payable to bearer or to order.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Negotiable Instruments—Kinds and Definitions.</b>—Any formal
or informal written promise to pay possessing these essentials is a
negotiable instrument. Examples are: promissory notes—notes receivable
and notes payable—drafts, checks, money orders and, with certain
restrictions, warehouse receipts.</p>

<p>A promissory note may be defined as an unconditional promise to pay a
specified sum of money at a certain time. It usually has a form similar
to the following:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_16" src="images/i_175a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="147" />
  <p class="f120">Form 16. Promissory Note</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Draft.</b>—A draft is a written order by one party on a
second party to pay to a third party the amount of money named. To
be negotiable, it must be so drawn as to meet the requirements of
negotiability named above. A draft may have a form similar to the
following:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_17" src="images/i_175b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="155" />
  <p class="f120">Form 17. A Draft</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
It will be noticed that there are three parties to a draft—the drawer,
the drawee, and the payee. The drawer is the person who draws the
draft and whose signature appears at the lower right-hand corner of
the draft. The drawee is the person on whom the draft is drawn, George
S. Perkins, above. He is sometimes called the payer. The payee is the
person who is to receive the payment ordered, James Stanley Jackson &amp; Co.</p>

<p>To understand the use of the draft as an instrument of business, suppose
the following relations exist between the three parties named above:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. George S. Perkins bought goods from Bert V. Robbins
on account for $175.</p>

<p>2. Robbins bought goods from James Stanley Jackson &amp; Co.
to the amount of $125.75 on account.</p>
</div>

<p>The problem will be discussed from the standpoint of Bert V. Robbins.
From the above data it is clear that Robbins has a claim against
Perkins for $175 and owes $125.75 to Jackson &amp; Co. Instead of
collecting the claim against the former and paying his debt to the
latter, he writes out a draft for $125.75 on Perkins, with Jackson &amp;
Co. as payee, thereby requesting (or ordering) Perkins to pay $125.75
to Jackson &amp; Co. This draft he sends to Jackson &amp; Co. and they present
it through their bankers to Perkins. Under ordinary circumstances
Perkins acknowledges the correctness of the draft and writes his
acceptance <i>on the face of it</i>, thereby promising to pay the
amount when due. Acceptances are usually worded in the following manner:</p>

<p class="center">Accepted, Oct. 6, 19—<br />Payable at First National Bank<br />
of Providence<br /><span class="smcap">George S. Perkins</span></p>

<p>It should be said that the three-party draft is not usually made use of
without the consent of the drawee previously obtained, as in the case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
of a bank check, which is a draft on the bank drawn by the depositor.
Very often in ordinary drafts, particularly when drawn against an
export of goods, the drawer makes out the draft in favor of himself and
indorses it in blank, thus making it transferable to bearer.</p>

<p><b>The Accepted Draft.</b>—When accepted, the draft becomes, to all
intents and purposes, an ordinary promissory note—Perkins’ promise to
pay Jackson &amp; Co. $125.75. Until the draft is accepted by Perkins, it
simply constitutes a request from Robbins to Perkins to pay the amount
named and the draft as such does not bind Perkins in any way. Hence, no
entry is made on the books of account of any of the three parties until
acceptance. Of course, a memorandum is kept of all drafts drawn.</p>

<p><b>Illustrative Entries.</b>—Upon acceptance by Perkins, the following
entries are made:</p>

<p>1. On the books of Jackson &amp; Co., the payee:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Notes Receivable</td>
      <td class="tdr">125.75</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">Bert V. Robbins</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">  125.75</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws2 fontsize_80">&emsp;Robbins’ draft on G. S. Perkins,<br />
                   &emsp;accepted by Perkins, payable December 5.</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Perkins’ acceptance, in possession of Jackson &amp; Co., constitutes
a claim against Perkins, and Jackson &amp; Co. therefore debit Notes
Receivable. They credit Robbins because this draft was sent to them by
Robbins in payment of Jackson’s open claim against Robbins for $125.75.</p>

<p>2. On the books of Perkins, the drawee:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Bert V. Robbins</td>
      <td class="tdr">125.75</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">Notes Payable</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">  125.75</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws2 fontsize_80">&emsp;Accepted Robbins’ draft
        at 60 days’ sight,<br />&emsp;favor of J. S. Jackson &amp; Co.</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
This entry cancels Perkins’ liability on open account to Robbins,
and shows as a substitution therefor the amount of his acceptance
in favor of Jackson &amp; Co. at Robbins’ request.</p>

<p>3. On the books of Robbins, the drawer:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">James Stanley Jackson &amp; Co.</td>
      <td class="tdr">125.75</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">George S. Perkins</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">  125.75</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws2 fontsize_80">&emsp;To record
                    the cancellation of our liability<br />
              &emsp;to Jackson &amp; Co. on open account, and to<br />
             &emsp;credit Perkins with his acceptance of our<br />
              &emsp;draft on him at 60 days’ sight.</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>From the point of view of Bert V. Robbins, the acceptance by Perkins
means two things: (1) the cancellation of a part of Robbins’ claim
against Perkins, and for this reason Robbins credits Perkins with
$125.75; (2) the cancellation of Robbins’ debt to Jackson &amp; Co., hence
Jackson &amp; Co. is debited on Robbins’ books for $125.75.</p>

<p>It is important to note here that in case Perkins fails to pay the
note at maturity, Robbins becomes liable to Jackson &amp; Co. Robbins may
therefore be considered the first indorser of the accepted draft. The
discussion of the manner of booking Robbins’ liability contingent upon
Perkins’ failure to pay is deferred to <a href="#Page_384">Chapter XLIII</a>.</p>

<p><b>Entries After Payment of the Draft.</b>—Upon payment by Perkins,
the following entries are made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. On Perkins’ books, a debit to Notes Payable
and a credit to Cash.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. On Jackson &amp; Co.’s books, a debit to Cash
and a credit to Notes Receivable.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Draft and Cash Compared as Instruments of Payment.</b>—The
following two diagrams may further illustrate the utility of the draft
as an instrument of trade.</p>

<p>2. Showing a settlement by draft—a clearing house method:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_179b.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="239" />
</div>

<p>The commercial, three-party draft is little used now. With the larger
function of banks in the conduct of modern business, other kinds
of drafts as discussed below have come into use. The three-party
relationship is the basis of all draft transactions, however, and must
therefore be thoroughly understood.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Drafts.</b>—There are several kinds of drafts,
which may be either sight or time instruments. A draft drawn “at sight”
is a request on the drawee to pay at sight, i.e., immediately upon
presentation to him. The use of the sight draft in making collections
is quite common. A delinquent customer is drawn on at sight and
collection is attempted through the bank. The method is oftentimes
effective because refusal to pay may reflect on the drawee’s credit
with his own bank. Usually no formal book entry is made of such drafts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
until paid. A draft drawn, say, “at 60 days’ (or 30 days’) sight” is a
request to pay 60 (or 30) days after presentation. Hence, the dating of
the acceptance of such a draft is of prime importance. Such a draft is,
of course, a time draft.</p>

<p>A draft drawn “60 (or other number) days after <i>date</i>” is called a
date draft and is payable 60 days from the date of the instrument—not,
as in the first case, 60 days after presentation or acceptance. It also
is a time draft. It is not necessary, although customary, to present
time drafts for acceptance.</p>

<p>Drafts may be “commercial” or “bank” according as the drawee is a
merchant or a bank, respectively. B. V. Robbins’ draft on Perkins shown
above is a merchant’s draft. A bank draft is a request by one bank on a
correspondent bank to pay a given amount of money to a named payee. A
customary method of remitting money is by the purchase and remittance
of a bank draft, for the issuing of which banks usually charge a fraction
of a per cent. To illustrate its use, take the following situation:</p>

<p>L. W. Roberts of Denver owes Field &amp; Co. of Chicago $210 on account.
Roberts goes to his Denver banker and buys a bank draft which may read
as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_18" src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="130" />
  <p class="f120">Form 18. A Bank Draft</p>
</div>

<p>Before sending this draft to Field &amp; Co., Roberts indorses it in favor
of Field &amp; Co., who upon its receipt deposit it with their own bank and
through it secure its collection from the Second National Bank. Roberts
pays his bank for the draft $210 plus exchange.</p>

<p>Drafts may be foreign or domestic. They are domestic when they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
drawn and payable within the same state or country; otherwise they
are foreign. According to the present usage, the term “draft” is used
whenever the parties concerned live within the United States, although
they may reside in different states, and the term “bill of exchange” is
applied to all such instruments where some of the parties live abroad.</p>

<p><b>The Trade Acceptance.</b>—The Federal Reserve Board defines a trade
acceptance as “a bill of exchange drawn by the seller on the purchaser
of goods sold and accepted by such purchaser.” The chief characteristic
of this document as contrasted with the ordinary draft is the showing
on its face of the origin of the transaction giving rise to the draft,
usually by means of the following statement: “The obligation of the
acceptor hereof arises out of the purchase of goods from the drawer.”
The following requirements to make a trade acceptance eligible for
rediscount by the federal reserve banks have been laid down by the
Federal Reserve Board:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. It must have arisen out of an actual
commercial transaction, usually the purchase and sale of commodities.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. It must have been drawn under a credit opened
for the purpose of conducting or settling accounts resulting from
business transactions involving the shipment or storage of goods.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. At the time of presentation to a federal
reserve bank for discount or as collateral for the loan of money, it
must have a maturity of not more than three months exclusive of days
of grace.</p>
</div>

<p>Trade acceptances are promissory notes just as are any other accepted
drafts. Because they comprise a very liquid asset, it is not unusual to
record them in an account, Trade Acceptances, and so distinguish them
from other notes and drafts. If they are few in number, they are more
usually recorded as Notes Receivable.</p>

<p><b>Checks.</b>—A check is a draft on a depositary bank. It is an
individual’s order to his bank of deposit to pay a named or designated
payee a certain sum of money. Two illustrations are given below,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
somewhat different in form but identical in nature. In the first,
likeness of the check to a draft is very evident.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_19" src="images/i_182.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="308" />
  <p class="f120">Form 19. Forms of Checks</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>certified check</i> is usually an individual’s or firm’s check
bearing the certification of the bank’s cashier that the check is good.
This certification is evidenced by writing across the face of the check
these or similar words:</p>

<p class="center">Good<br />when properly indorsed<br />
<span class="smcap">First National Bank<br />
F. G. Moffitt, Cashier</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">Such a certification makes the bank responsible
for its payment.</p>

<p>A cashier’s check is a bank’s own check drawn on itself in favor of a
third party and signed by its cashier. As a medium of exchange it ranks
higher than the check of a private person, due to the superior credit
of the bank and to the fact that the bank is usually more generally
known in a community.</p>

<p><b>Other Negotiable Instruments.</b>—<i>Express</i> and <i>postal
money orders</i> are drafts payable at sight, drawn respectively by one
express agent on another and by one postmaster on another.</p>

<p>A warehouse receipt is a receipt from a warehouse, elevator, or other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
storage concern acknowledging the receipt of goods or property. Such
a receipt usually contains the contract agreements entered into by
the parties, covering the conditions according to which the goods are
accepted for storage. The warehouse receipt is usually negotiable, or
partially so, in that title to the property may pass with its transfer.</p>

<p><b>Principles Governing the Writing of Commercial Paper.</b>—Ordinary
prudence requires commercial paper to be drawn in a way that will make
forgery difficult if not impossible. To this end the following two
rules should be observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Leave no blank spaces, particularly where
the amount is written. This is not so important when the amount is
perforated, with a perforated star at each side.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Write the indorsement at the top margin.
Unless this is done, some statement might be inserted which would
change materially the effect of the signature; e.g., the payer might
later write above the signature that the check is accepted in full
payment for a definite bill.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Kinds of Indorsement.</b>—An indorsement is usually for the purpose
of transferring title. There are several kinds of indorsement, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. A <i>blank</i> indorsement, which consists
only of the payee’s signature; this renders the instrument payable to
bearer.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. A <i>full</i> indorsement, which reads as
follows: “Pay to the order of . . . . . . . . .,” giving the name of the
indorsee, i.e., the person to whom the instrument is transferred, and
followed by the signature of the indorser, who before his indorsement
was the payee.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. A <i>qualified</i> indorsement, which is
either a blank or full indorsement with the words “without recourse”
added to it. This kind of indorsement transfers title with no liability
attaching to the transferor in case of non-payment by the maker at
maturity.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. A <i>restrictive</i> indorsement, giving the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
name of the party to whom the check is transferred, the words “for
collection” or “for collection and deposit” being added and followed
by the signature. This indorsement does not transfer title but
merely appoints the person or bank named as agent for the purpose of
collection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">BUSINESS PAPERS—THE GOODS INVOICE <br />
AND BILL OF LADING</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Definition.</b>—When a business transaction takes place, a record
or memorandum of its amount and nature is usually made out. Thus, the
amount of cash received for a sale may be rung up on the cash register
or a sales clerk may make out a duplicate sales ticket and turn over
the carbon copy as a sales memorandum to the bookkeeper; for cash
disbursed a receipt, to be the basis for formal entry on the books, may
be demanded from the person to whom the payment is made.</p>

<p>These memoranda of business transactions are called “business papers.”
They comprise all of the more or less formal and informal documents
which constitute the firsthand evidence of most transactions. Among
the most common business papers may be mentioned: the goods invoice for
purchases or sales; negotiable paper, including the check, note, draft,
money order, and warehouse receipt; the statement and account sales;
the shipping order and bill of lading; the bill of sale; the lease
agreement; and contracts of all sorts. A few of the business papers
most frequently used will be explained.</p>

<p><b>The Invoice.</b>—When a merchant sells goods to a customer he
writes out an itemized “bill” which is sent along with the goods. This
bill, loosely called an “invoice,” is from the seller’s viewpoint more
accurately described as a sales invoice, and from the customer’s or
buyer’s viewpoint as a purchase invoice. It is an itemized statement of
goods bought or sold, and should state the names of vendor and vendee,
the address of the vendor and the date of sale, the quantities, kinds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and prices of the goods, the terms of sale, and additional information
as to method of shipment, etc.</p>

<p><b>Handling the Purchase Invoice.</b>—When goods are bought the
purchase invoice should be verified or audited. The method of audit
depends upon the organization of the business. In a small business,
if the invoice is received before arrival of the goods, it is usually
held till their arrival and then checked against them as to quantities,
quality, and price. The extensions and total are verified and entry
made in the purchase journal, using the audited invoice as a basis.
The invoice should then be placed in a temporary file till paid, after
which it is usually filed under the vendor’s name for future reference.
The check in payment of the invoice, when returned canceled by the
bank, is frequently attached to the invoice for which it was issued as
evidence of its settlement. At any rate the paid invoice should bear on
its face a notation to show the payment.</p>

<p>In a large business where the clerical work is divided among
departments, several copies of the original purchase order sent to the
vendor are usually made out—one copy, for instance, for the purchasing
department, one for the receiving room, one for the auditing department
and so on. The procedure of auditing is then more complex. The copy
furnished the receiving room is usually left blank as to quantities,
and sometimes the description of the goods ordered is also omitted.
When the goods are received, quantities and kinds are filled in by the
receiving department, and the copy is sent to the auditing department
where it is checked against the auditor’s copy of the original order
and the purchase invoice from the vendor. If found correct as to
quantity, kinds of goods, extensions, and additions, the invoice
becomes the basis for entry in the purchase record—journal or voucher
register as the case may be—after which it follows the customary
routine as to filing. The invoice remains in a temporary file as long
as it is unpaid. Upon payment it is placed in a permanent file, either
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
under the name of the vendor, by invoice number, or according to
whatever system may be in use.</p>

<p><b>Handling the Sales Invoice.</b>—Practically all systems of handling
sales require that at the time of the sale some record or memo of the
transaction be made. In retail establishments the use by each salesman
of a book of sales tickets with provision for duplicate or triplicate
impression is very general, whether the sale be cash or charge. The
cash and charge tickets are usually put up in separate books and a
different color of paper is used for each. At the close of the day the
total cash tickets are checked against the cash received from cash
sales, and the total charge tickets give a controlling figure for
charges to customers. The total of the cash tickets plus that of the
charge tickets gives the total credit to Sales.</p>

<p>These sales tickets are usually entered on a daily sales sheet provided
with distributive columns for analysis according to departments or
kinds of commodities. A recapitulation giving the totals of each of
these columns is made and posted to the ledger, while the customers
ledger accounts may receive their charges direct from the sales ticket.
This recapitulation really constitutes the sales journal record, as is
explained in <a href="#Page_433">Chapter XLVII</a>.</p>

<p>Where the number of charge accounts is not large, a folder system is
sometimes used. Each charge sales ticket is placed in the folder which
takes the place of that customer’s account, thus avoiding the necessity
of making a formal entry on the ledger. When the customer pays this
bill, the sales ticket is so marked and is either left in the folder
or transferred to a permanent file. The successful operation of the
folder system presupposes that the customer will pay the exact amount
of his bills shortly after the date of the ticket, no provision being
made to care for overlapping credits. Whatever the system, the sales
ticket is the original record of the transaction and therefore valuable
as evidence in case of dispute. These tickets should be filed away and
kept until all danger of dispute is past.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p><b>Credits and Returned Goods Invoices.</b>—If for any reason goods
purchased prove unsatisfactory and are returned, record of their return
should be kept by the shipping clerk and used as a basis for securing
proper credit from the vendor. The vendor usually sends a returned
goods invoice, which, though similar in form to the purchase invoice,
constitutes a <i>credit</i> to the purchaser instead of a charge. These
credit memos, as they are termed, are always of some distinctive color,
frequently red, in order to distinguish them readily from the regular
invoice.</p>

<p>Similarly, when dissatisfied customers return goods, or when the
business makes them an allowance on goods sold, a credit invoice or
credit memo is sent them and the duplicate copy of this memo retained
in the office becomes the basis for entering the transaction on the
books.</p>

<p><b>Shipping Goods—The Bill of Lading.</b>—The purchase and sale of
goods usually involve dealings with railroads. It is not the purpose
of this chapter to give an extensive system or method of handling
shipments, but merely to explain the purpose of the railroad documents
and their use as business papers.</p>

<p>A shipment of goods is evidenced always by a “bill of lading,” a
contract under which the railroad accepts freight for carriage, defines
its liabilities as a transportation company or warehouseman, and states
its duties and those of the shipper. Its standard content is prescribed
by the Interstate Commerce Commission, although any additions to it not
in conflict with the standard content are not forbidden. If the shipper
so desires, he may have bills of lading printed to conform in size with
his own files, instead of using those furnished by the railroad. There
are two standard forms, the <i>straight</i> bill of lading which is not
negotiable and the <i>order</i> bill of lading which is negotiable.</p>

<p>The bill of lading is always made out in triplicate, the original and
the two copies being identical except as to titles and signatures.
The original is signed by the shipper and the railway agent, and
constitutes the shipper’s receipt for the goods delivered to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
railroad. The second copy called the “shipping order,” is signed by the
shipper only. It is his order to the railroad to ship the goods, and
is held by the railroad as evidence of its authority. The third copy
or memo is an exact duplicate of the original. Like the first copy,
it is signed by the shipper and the agent, and is held by the shipper
as a duplicate receipt. Sometimes it is forwarded with the invoice to
the customer, but otherwise should be filed by the shipper with the
original bill of lading. In case of claim against the railroad for loss
or damage to goods in transit, the original bill of lading is required
as evidence and should therefore always be kept in the shipper’s
possession.</p>

<p><b>Freight Notice and Expense Bill.</b>—A notice, called “freight
notice,” is sent by the railroad to the consignee upon arrival of
the goods. A more or less formal order is given by the consignee to
the teamster or drayage company to call for the freight. This order
authorizes the railroad to deliver it to the teamster or drayage
company. Upon its delivery, an “expense” or freight bill is sent to
the consignee itemizing the freight charges due on the shipment. The
freight notice and the freight bill are usually made at one impression,
the heading on the one being a notice of the arrival of freight, while
on the other the heading is that of an ordinary invoice or bill showing
the freight charges on the designated goods. Some railroads make three
copies at one impression, consisting of (1) the freight notice, (2)
the delivery receipt, and (3) the freight bill. Copy (2) is a receipt
surrendered by the consignee upon delivery of the goods.</p>

<p><b>C. O. D. Shipments.</b>—C. O. D. shipments are handled through
the agency of an express company, the post-office, or a bank. Express
companies accept for shipment freight which is to be paid for upon
delivery, agreeing to collect and remit the amount of the invoice to
the consignor less collection and remittance charges. This method of
shipping sometimes gives the consignee the privilege of examination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
before acceptance. It is used with customers who are unknown to the
shipper or with those whose credit is doubtful.</p>

<p>When the parcels post service is used for shipping goods C. O. D.,
the post-office makes the collection for the shipper. The shipper must,
of course, always prepay the postage, although this may by agreement
become a charge against the customer.</p>

<p>When a bank is made the shipper’s agent to collect on delivery, a
draft is drawn on the consignee and sent to the bank along with a
special C. O. D. bill of lading, the <i>order</i> bill referred to
above. This original C. O. D. bill together with the attached draft is
sent by the bank to its correspondent located in the same city as the
consignee. The correspondent bank presents the draft to the consignee
for acceptance or payment, as the case may be, and thereupon delivers
the special bill of lading to him. The shipper’s order to the railroad
provides that the goods are to be delivered only upon presentation by
the consignee of this special bill of lading. In the use of the order
bill of lading, it is customary for the original copy to show the goods
consigned to the order of the shipper himself. This copy, indorsed by
the shipper, and the attached draft are the documents used by the bank
in making the collection.</p>

<p><b>Duties of the Traffic Department.</b>—In a large business a special
department known as the traffic department is authorized to handle all
shipments. Briefly, its duties are to look after all incoming freight,
its receipt in good condition and its proper distribution to the
several departments; to handle all outgoing freight, its proper routing
so as to secure lowest tariffs and speedy delivery; and to secure the
adjustment of claims for damage or loss of goods in transit.</p>

<p><b>The Statement of Account.</b>—When goods are sold, an invoice or
bill showing terms of sale, quantities, items, prices, and total amount
of sale is sent to the customer. Periodically, frequently the last of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
the month, a statement is rendered each customer whose account shows a
debit balance. Frequently the date of sending the statement is recorded
in the explanation column of the ledger account, which, from a credit
point of view, is a desirable practice.</p>

<p>The statement of account is a transcript, sometimes a summary, of
the customer’s ledger account, i.e., it contains all charges and all
credits for the period covered. If there is a balance outstanding
at the beginning of the month, the current statement opens with the
balance item and is followed by lists of all charges, payments, and
other credits for the current period; the total credits are subtracted
from the total charges and the balance constitutes the amount now due
and owing. Sometimes a statement of account is made out in detail,
giving a copy of the original invoices which evidence the several sales
transactions. Statements of account are issued in many different forms,
but the following illustration shows all the essentials:</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">BANKS AND THEIR METHODS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Service of the Bank to the Community.</b>—Practically all business
houses at the present time take advantage of the banking facilities to
be found in every community where there is enough business transacted
to justify the establishment of a bank. A bank is sometimes defined
as an institution which deals in money and credit. One of its chief
functions and the one on which its main income is <i>based</i> is that
of acting as a place for the deposit of moneys, these deposits forming
the basis for its loans and discounts. Among its other important
functions and services are to collect drafts and checks drawn on
other banks; to issue and sell its own drafts on other banks, thereby
enabling its customers to make payments to out-of-town creditors;
to discount commercial paper, i.e., to loan money to its patrons on
approved security; and to issue paper currency.</p>

<p><b>Opening an Account with the Bank.</b>—Because so much of the
bank’s business is based on the honor and integrity of its customers,
a prospective depositor is usually required to present a card of
introduction signed by a customer of the bank or someone else known to
it. A depositor who wishes to open a checking account is asked to file
a “signature” card bearing the signatures which he will use in signing
checks. As considerable expense attaches to handling depositors’
accounts, some banks require that the balance of the account shall
never fall below a fixed minimum.</p>

<p><b>The Deposit Ticket.</b>—When an account is opened, the depositor is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
provided with a pass-book and check book. All deposits are made by
means of deposit tickets, discount memoranda, or collection notices.
The deposit ticket is in form similar to the following:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_21" src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="595" />
  <p class="f120">Form 21. Bank Deposit Ticket</p>
</div>

<p>All moneys and checks deposited are listed on this ticket under the
indicated classifications. The deposit is handed to the receiving
teller of the bank, who, after verifying the ticket, makes an entry of
the amount in the depositor’s pass-book. Duplicate deposit tickets are
usually kept by the depositor. It is important to note that checks must
be indorsed before they are deposited, so as to make them collectible
by the bank.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p><b>The Pass-Book.</b>—The pass-book is the record of the depositor’s
dealings with his bank and, although written up by the bank teller,
it is usually kept from the depositor’s viewpoint, i.e., the bank is
debited with all deposits and credited with all checks presented for
payment. At stated intervals, say monthly, the book is left with the
bank for balancing, at which time the <i>total</i> amount of checks
paid by the bank is entered in the pass-book and the canceled checks
are returned to the depositor. Sometimes the pass-book is kept in
account form, the left page indicating deposits, and the right page
payments by the bank. More frequently, however, the pages of the
pass-book do not have debit and credit significance but constitute a
continuous record. In this case, at the end of the period, the deposits
are footed and the total of the checks is <i>subtracted</i> from the
total deposits, thus showing the balance due the depositor.</p>

<p>A method coming into quite general use among banks is to send a monthly
statement of account just as trading concerns do. This statement is
a transcript of the bank’s ledger account kept with each depositor,
showing deposits and withdrawals. When this is done, withdrawals are
not entered on the pass-book, which thus serves only as a memo or
receipt of the moneys deposited.</p>

<p><b>The Check Book.</b>—The check book is provided either with a stub,
counterfoil, or interleaf, for making a duplicate record of the check
drawn. Provision is usually made in the check book for the entry of the
deposits. Sometimes each check is subtracted from the previous balance
and the amount of the new balance shown; more often, total checks and
total deposits are shown separately and in this way, while it is an
easy matter to find the balance by subtracting the total checks from
the total deposits, the actual figure does not appear and hence is not
available to curious eyes.</p>

<p>The balance shown in the monthly statement or by the periodic balance
of the pass-book is seldom the same as that shown in the depositor’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
check book, due to the fact that certain checks issued by the depositor
have not yet been presented for payment to the bank. The method of
reconciling the pass-book with the bank balance is treated in
<a href="#Page_468">Chapter L</a>, “Accounts Current.”</p>

<p><b>Securing a Loan through the Discount of a Note.</b>—A common
practice of business men in borrowing money is to discount or sell to
their bank or to a broker their own promissory notes and those received
from customers. When merchants discount their own notes at a bank,
the notes bear only one signature, that of the merchant, and for this
reason they are called “one-name” paper. If a merchant receives a note
from a customer, indorses it, and then discounts it at the bank, two
signatures appear on it—that of the original maker and that of the
indorser. Notes of this kind are called “two-name” paper. Banks usually
prefer two-name paper because, if the maker fails to pay the note at
maturity, the indorser can be held liable for its payment, while in the
case of one-name paper the bank has recourse to no one except the maker.</p>

<p>When a merchant makes out a promissory note of, say, $1,000 due 90 days
after date, and discounts it at his bank, the bank usually deducts
interest at, say, 6%, from the face of the note; i.e., the merchant is
credited not for the full $1,000 but only for $985, and when the note
matures he either pays the amount, $1,000, or his account is debited
with it. The $15 is called “discount” because it is “subtracted” from
the face of the note; but since this item is paid for the use of the
amount loaned by the bank, it is of the same nature as interest. There
is no reason, therefore, for keeping two separate ledger accounts, one
for discount and one for interest paid, the two usually being combined
under one title, “Interest and Discount” or “Interest.”</p>

<p><b>Principles to be Observed in the Calculation of Interest.</b>—In
connection with interest computations it is important to observe the
following points, the principles involved in each case being best
explained by making use of suitable illustrations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>1. In commercial practice, when the interest period is expressed in
months, the interest for each month is one-twelfth of the annual
interest, i.e., a note for $1,000 dated April 11, 19—, due “three
months from date,” matures July 11 and the interest at 6% is 6% of
$1,000 divided by 12 multiplied by 3, or</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>

   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
      <td class="tdl">  = $15</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">12</td>
      <td class="tdc"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>2. Were the same note worded “ninety days from date,” it would mature
<i>July 10</i> instead of July 11, the number of intervening days being
19 in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, and 10 in July; total 90 days. The
interest would amount to</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">$1,000 × .06 × 90</td>
      <td class="tdc"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
      <td class="tdl">  = $15</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">360</td>
      <td class="tdc"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>3. If a note is dated March 6, 19—, and matures, say, on April 30, the
interest period is 55 days (25 in March and 30 in April). Usually, in
computing the number of days in the interest period the opening date
is omitted but the closing date is included. In some instances the
practice is to include both days.</p>

<p>It is important to note that it is almost a universal custom to use
360 as a denominator in all these cases, although the theoretically
correct number is 365. This is done for the reason that the use of
360 greatly facilitates the computation. The government of the United
States makes an exception to this rule and counts the year as 365 days,
and disregards the month as a unit base; i.e., instead of counting the
month of January as <big>¹/₁₂</big> of a year, its computation requires
the use of the fraction <big>³¹/₃₆₅</big> as the multiplier. Interest
on $1,000 for, say, 12 days, by this method, amounts to</p>

      <td class="tdc"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
The incorrectness resulting from the commercial method (using 360
days as denominator) usually is negligible and is fully justified by
the economy of time in computation. It may be noted that under this
practice the amount of annual interest is ¹/₇₂ more than under the
method used by the government.</p>

<p>4. When paper is discounted by a bank, even though its term be given
in months, the bank invariably counts the exact number of days in
estimating the amount of the discount. Take a note dated June 25 with a
term of 3 months and due therefore on September 25, but discounted at
the bank on July 25. The term of discount, instead of being 2 months,
would be for 62 days, a gain to the bank of 2 days on a 360-day basis.</p>

<p><b>Short Methods of Interest Computation.</b>—In calculating interest
or discount, the so-called 12% or 6% method seems the easiest of
application. Its base is taken as $1. In the 12% method the interest
for a year is therefore 12 cents, for a month 1 cent, and for a day ⅓
mill. In the 6% method, the interest for a year is 6 cents, for a month
½ cent, and for a day ⅙ mill. Using these fractions with the years,
months, and days as multipliers, the result is the interest on $1 for
the given period. This result multiplied by the face of the note gives
the required interest, assuming that the interest rate is 12% or 6%.</p>

<p>A variation of the above gives the following rule, somewhat easier to
apply. Reduce the time to days—using a 360-day year, 30-day month
basis; multiply the time by the face, point off three places (i.e.,
treat the product as mills), and divide by 3 or 6 according as the
calculation is on a 12% or 6% basis. If the basis used is 6%, but the
actual rate is different, add or subtract whatever aliquot part the
given rate is more or less than 6%; i.e., if the rate is 8%, add ²/₆ or
⅓; if 5%, subtract ⅙; etc. The following example will illustrate:</p>

<p class="blockquot">A note for $1,000 dated June 10, 19—, for 4
months, with interest at 7%, was discounted July 30 at 8%. Find the
net proceeds. The note when due will be worth $1,000 plus 4 months’
interest at 7%. That becomes the basis for the discount calculation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">METHODS OF POSTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Journal and Ledger Records Differentiated—Posting.</b>—When a
correct and complete record of business transactions has been made in
the various journals, practically all the current information needed
by the business has been secured. However, because this information
is recorded in chronological order, it is not available for use. It
requires sorting, grouping, and indexing. To meet this requirement the
original chronological record must be transferred to other records
which provide for the desired grouping. The separation of the general
journal into journals for different classes of transactions such
as sales, purchases, and cash, results in making certain kinds of
information somewhat more available, but more than this is required
for business management. The original records must be grouped and
summarized under proper account titles, so that the total results for
the period may be had under review at one time. The book containing
these account titles is called the ledger, and the transfer of the
original record to the ledger is called posting.</p>

<p><b>Time of Posting.</b>—Where subsidiary journals are used, it is not
customary to post all entries at the same time. The entries affecting
personal accounts, i.e., those of customers and creditors, should
be posted daily. Inquiries from customers as to their balances are
received every day, and in order that this information may be given
promptly and correctly, customers ledger accounts should be kept up to
date in every respect. This is a matter of great importance because, if
the information desired by the customer is not given promptly, or if
an error is made in giving it, thus calling for correction at a later
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
date, the customer’s good-will may be lost and his trade transferred
to others. For this reason personal accounts, especially those with
customers, should be posted daily, and great care should be exercised
in doing the work.</p>

<p>All other accounts may have their postings made periodically—once a
week or once a month—the frequency depending upon the need of the
business for the information furnished by the accounts. The flow of
cash—always of importance—is shown daily by the cash book record;
the volume of sales each day can be had from the sales journal; but
information as to expenses can usually be had only from the ledger
after completing the weekly or monthly postings.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Posting.</b>—Knowing that errors in posting are easily
made and that when made they may cause great confusion, it is important
for the bookkeeper to know what kinds of errors occur most frequently,
and to study means of avoiding them. Certain methods of posting have
been found to produce a minimum of error. Some points in connection
therewith will be considered here.</p>

<p>One of the chief errors in posting is to make entry on the wrong side
of the account, i.e., to post a debit as a credit, or vice versa. The
use of subsidiary journals has done away with a large part of errors of
this kind, yet it is advisable to keep the following points constantly
in mind when posting:</p>

<p>1. The sales journal is a “charge” journal, i.e., the individual items
represent debits and must therefore be posted to the debit side of
the proper ledger accounts. The sales <i>summaries</i>, however, are
credits and must be posted as such.</p>

<p>2. The purchase journal is a “credit” record and all postings, except
summaries, are made to the credit side of the respective accounts.</p>

<p>3. In the cash receipts journal, each individual item represents a
credit, as explained in a previous chapter, and each individual item in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the cash disbursements journal represents a debit. Hence, postings of
the individual items on the debit side of the cash book must be made
to the credit side of the ledger account, and postings of items on
the credit side of the cash book must be made to the debit side of
the ledger accounts. The posting of the summary entries of the cash
book follows the debit and credit designation made at the time of
summarization. The principles here involved were fully discussed in
<a href="#Page_147">Chapter XIX</a>.</p>

<p>4. In the Journal the debits and credits of each entry are fully
expressed, i.e., neither element is suppressed. In posting from this
record it is best to transfer all the debits consecutively and then all
the credits. The possibility of posting a debit item as a credit is
thereby greatly reduced.</p>

<p><b>Cross-Indexing the Entries.</b>—An essential part of posting, in
addition to recording the date and the amount, is to cross-index every
entry, i.e., to index it both in the book of original entry and in
the ledger. The “folio” column in each book is used for this purpose.
The index in the ledger consists of the first letter of the book of
original entry followed by the page number, and the index in the book
of original entry shows the number of the ledger page to which the item
is posted. (<a href="#FORM_22">See Form 22</a>.)</p>

<p>In this way, when the indexing in both books is completed it is
possible without loss of time to trace the entry from the journal to
the ledger, and vice versa. Usually the ledger folio is entered in the
book of original entry immediately after each item is posted. When this
is done the absence of a reference number in the journal indicates that
the item has been omitted in posting. This check is frequently helpful
in tracing errors. Some bookkeepers, however, before doing any posting,
go through the book of original entry and from the account index of
the ledger enter in the ledger folio column of that particular journal
the ledger page numbers. By this method, much time is saved in finding
the account in the ledger, but a <i>check mark</i> should be placed
after each item as soon as it is posted, to indicate the fact. Then the
absence of the <i>check mark</i> indicates an unposted item.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
<b>Explanatory Matter in the Ledger.</b>—In posting personal accounts
it is customary to show the terms of credit in the explanation column
of the account. In this way the face of the account shows whether the
customer pays promptly or not, and affords a basis for his credit rating.</p>

<p>Notes Payable and Notes Receivable accounts in the ledger should show
essential data, such as due date, interest rate, etc. However, when a
separate note or bill book is used, these data are given therein and
may be omitted from the account in the ledger.</p>

<p>With all other accounts, except sometimes the Profit and Loss account,
little or no explanatory matter is carried. However, when a posting is
made that is at all unusual, it is well to enter explanatory matter in
the ledger. From the business man’s point of view, the ledger is the
most important book of account, and if its record can be so made as to
require a minimum of reference to original books, it serves its purpose
so much the better. Where possible, the Profit and Loss account should
carry the names of the accounts closed into it; in fact all transfers,
whether made on the face of the ledger or by journal entry, should
carry the account title and the ledger folio to which and from which
the item is transferred. It is a fundamental principle that every entry
must be indexed in such a way as to render reference to it easy at any time.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE TRIAL BALANCE AND<br />
METHODS OF LOCATING ERRORS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Trial Balance.</b>—In <a href="#Page_106">Chapter XIV</a>
the trial balance was defined as a list of account <i>totals</i>, debit
and credit, or account <i>balances</i>, debit or credit, for all the
<i>open</i> accounts in the ledger. This list is set up in two columns,
debit and credit, and if the original entries in the journals and the
postings to the ledger have been done correctly, the totals of these
two columns should be the same.</p>

<p>Neither method of showing the trial balance has any inherent advantage
over the other. Some concerns desire the account totals to be shown
in the trial balance, as that indicates to some extent the volume of
business. This would be true of all accounts which had been opened
during the current period. As to those carried over from a previous
period little current information would be given. As a general thing,
however, the status of <i>customers’</i> accounts is better indicated
when both total charges and total credits are shown. Where only the
balance is shown, it does not provide any basis for determining
whether that balance is normal for that particular account. In judging
a request for a further extension of credit there is a rather close
relationship between the volume of trade with a customer and the amount
of his unsettled balance.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even the totals of accounts that <i>balance</i> are shown
in the trial balance, thus giving the status of <i>all</i> accounts
appearing in the ledger. Again, concerns desirous of knowing the
net amount owing on customers’ accounts and the net amount owed on
creditors’ claims, require <i>balances</i> of all personal accounts and
cash, but debit and credit <i>totals</i> of all other accounts. No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
unalterable rule can be given. The manner of showing the accounts in
the trial balance is governed by the way in which the trial balance
is to be used and the purpose it is to serve. Manifestly, however,
the trial balance cannot give information of every kind desired by
a manager. As personal accounts are usually handled by canceling
offsetting credits against corresponding debits and carrying only
balances forward, the trial balance cannot well show at the same
time both total transactions and outstanding balances. Only in small
concerns could the trial balance give the information which in larger
concerns would be gathered statistically and furnished in addition to
the trial balance.</p>

<p>The tendency in modern accounting is to make the ledger record so
detailed that all accounts are <i>currently</i> “uniphase,” i.e.,
have entries on but one side, and in connection with such accounts
the two methods of entering them in the trial balance are identical,
because the total of the one side of the account is at the same time
the balance of the account. It must be observed that as a matter of
course this modern tendency does not apply to personal accounts nor to
adjustment and closing accounts.</p>

<p><b>Errors in the Trial Balance.</b>—The manner of entering the small
pencil footings of both sides of each account and also the account
balances previous to taking the trial balance, was explained in an
earlier chapter. This preliminary work should be done carefully so as
to reduce errors to a minimum.</p>

<p>It is not purposed here to discuss all the kinds of errors that find
their way into the accounting records. Errors are frequently made in
the original analysis and classification of the transaction, which, as
previously stated, result in an entirely incorrect showing of financial
condition. Such errors do not affect the balance of the books and are
not detected by the trial balance. Their detection is one phase of the
professional auditor’s work. This discussion has been qualified by
saying that <i>if</i> the work of original and secondary entry has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
done correctly, then the ledger should prove. Some points in connection
with errors which often occur in posting will be treated here.</p>

<p>The equality of the two totals of the trial balance proves that for
every debit entry on the books there has been made an equal credit,
or at any rate that the sum of all debit entries equals the sum of
all credit entries; i.e., it proves only the <i>mathematical</i>
correctness of the work.</p>

<p>It might happen that an item, though posted to the <i>correct side</i>
of the ledger, has been entered in the <i>wrong account</i>. The trial
balance would not detect an error of this kind. For example, John
Doe’s account might be debited with a charge belonging to Richard Roe,
both being customers. This of course would make the books show wrong
balances in those particular accounts, but would not cause an incorrect
showing in the <i>total</i> assets. However, more serious results may
come from an error caused by posting to the wrong account.</p>

<p>According to the schedules shown earlier, all transactions bring about
increases and decreases in the three main groups of accounts, viz.,
assets, liabilities, and proprietorship. A transaction resulting
in an increase of assets may have its credit in any of the three
classes—decrease of assets, increase of liabilities, or increase
of proprietorship. A credit entry in any one of these would result
in an exact offset to the debit and would therefore so far as that
transaction was concerned, result in equal debits and credits in the
trial balance; but were entry made to the wrong group of accounts, it
would bring about absolutely false results. This would be the case
if a proprietorship account were credited, resulting in an increased
profit, when the credit should have been to the liability group with a
resulting increase of the liabilities—two divergent results.</p>

<p>Thus, while the trial balance does not detect errors in posting to the
wrong account, it has great value in that its equality is considered
as good evidence of the correctness of the books. This is so because
errors of the kind just referred to are not of so frequent occurrence
as those involving only the mathematics of the work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p><b>Suggestions for Locating Errors.</b>—Where trial balance totals
do not agree, it is certain that one or more errors have been made
somewhere. The following suggestions may be useful in locating them:</p>

<p>1. If there is a difference of 1 in any column, i.e., .01, .10, 1.00,
10.00, etc., the error very likely results from wrong addition. Check
additions of the trial balance and if the error is not located there,
those of the ledger accounts must be checked as well.</p>

<p>2. If the difference between the two trial balance totals is an even
number, divide this difference by two and look through the trial
balance for an item of that amount but entered as a debit instead of a
credit or vice versa. The amount of the error must be divided by two
because the placing of a given item in the wrong column would result
in a difference of <i>twice</i> this amount in the totals of the trial
balance. If the error is not located in the trial balance, it may be
necessary to look through the ledger accounts because the wrong placing
may have occurred there.</p>

<p>In checking through the ledger for an error of this kind, some aid is
afforded by the fact that all postings from <i>even</i> pages in the
cash book (i.e., the cash receipts) appear on the <i>credit</i> side
of the ledger accounts, and all postings from the <i>odd</i> pages in
the cash book appear on the <i>debit</i> side of the ledger accounts.
If, therefore, in any of the <i>credit</i> reference columns in the
ledger is seen a reference like “C 13” or “C 29,” or in any of the
<i>debit</i> reference columns an index like “C 40” or “C 58,” it is
probable that the error is due to posting to the wrong side.</p>

<p>3. If the mistake has not been found in this way, the trial balance
should be checked against the ledger to be sure that no open accounts
have been omitted. Examine all closed accounts to see that they balance.</p>

<p>4. Examine the posting index column of all books of <i>original</i>
entry to see that no items have been omitted in posting.</p>

<p>5. When the totals of the trial balance are unequal, the error may lie
either in the debit total or in the credit total, or both may be wrong.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
Even when the trial balance “proves,” both totals may contain the same
error. In order to determine what is the correct footing, the following
method may sometimes be applied: Take the total of the previous trial
balance, add to it the current totals from the several journals, and
deduct the total of all accounts closed during the period. The result
shows the correct footing for the present trial balance. Where the
number of accounts closed during the period is large, the work entailed
by this method may be prohibitive. The method is of easy application
only when the trial balance is taken by means of debit and credit
totals.</p>

<p>It may be left to the student to prove why this is a correct method for
determining the present trial balance total. Suffice it to say that it
is based on the fundamental fact that for every credit item in any of
the journals there is of necessity a debit or group of debits the total
of which corresponds with the credit item. Duplicating entries in two
or more journals must be eliminated from the journal total.</p>

<p>The following table will serve to illustrate the above method:</p>

<p>6. If the difference between trial balance totals is divisible by 9,
the error may be due to a <i>transposition</i> of figures or to a
<i>transplacement</i>, sometimes called a <i>slide</i>. A transposition
is an interchange of figures, as 96 for 69, 215 for 512, 6,274 for
4,276, etc. The first is called a simple or one-column transposition,
the second a two-column, and the last a three-column transposition.
One-column transpositions may also occur in numbers of three or more
figures, as 172 for 712, or 3,129 for 1,329.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p><b>Transpositions.</b>—The following rules will be of help in locating
errors of transposition. To determine divisibility by 9, the easiest
way is to “cast out” the 9’s.</p>

<p>(a) If the difference between the trial balance totals is divisible
by 9 and consists of less than three figures, i.e., 9, 18, 27, 36, a
one-column transposition may be the cause of the error. Divide this
difference by 9. If the quotient is 1, the difference between the two
transposed figures is 1. If the quotient is 2 or 3 or 4, the difference
between the transposed figures is 2 or 3 or 4, etc. For instance:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <thead><tr>
      <th class="tdc">Correct<br /> Number </th>
      <th class="tdc"> Transposed <br />Number</th>
      <th class="tdc">  Difference</th>
      <th class="tdc"> </th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc">54</td>
      <td class="tdc">45</td>
      <td class="tdc">9</td>
      <td class="tdc">divided by 9 = 1</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">87</td>
      <td class="tdc">78</td>
      <td class="tdc">9</td>
      <td class="tdc">&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 1</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">75</td>
      <td class="tdc">57</td>
      <td class="tdc">18</td>
      <td class="tdc">&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 2</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">97</td>
      <td class="tdc">79</td>
      <td class="tdc">18</td>
      <td class="tdc">&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 2</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">30</td>
      <td class="tdc">03</td>
      <td class="tdc">27</td>
      <td class="tdc">&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 3</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">85</td>
      <td class="tdc">58</td>
      <td class="tdc">27</td>
      <td class="tdc">&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 3</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Thus the figures in the last column indicate the difference between the
figures of the original item.</p>

<p>(b) If the difference is divisible by 9 and consists of two significant
figures followed by one or more naughts, the error may be caused by a
<i>one-column</i> transposition between columns of a higher order. For
instance:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">The correct amount being</td>
      <td class="tdr">6,394</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">and the transposed amount&emsp; </td>
      <td class="tdr bb">3,694</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">the difference is</td>
      <td class="tdr">2,700</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">which divided by 9 gives 300. This indicates a
transposition between figures in the “100” and “1,000” columns, the
difference between these figures being 3. Reference to the example
given will show this to be the case.</p>

<p>(c) When the difference between the trial balance totals is divisible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
by 9 and lies between 99 and 1,000, the error may be due to a
<i>two-column</i> transposition. Here the middle figure of the error
is always a 9, e.g., an error of 297 resulting from writing 512 as
215. Dividing the number (27) formed by the two outside figures of the
difference by 9, the quotient (3) is the difference between the two
transposed figures, i.e., the 5 and the 2. For instance:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <thead><tr>
      <th class="tdc">Correct<br /> Number </th>
      <th class="tdc"> Transposed <br />Number</th>
      <th class="tdc">  Difference</th>
      <th class="tdc"> </th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc">514</td>
      <td class="tdc">415</td>
      <td class="tdc">99</td>
      <td class="tdc"> 9 divided by 9 = 1</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">735</td>
      <td class="tdc">537</td>
      <td class="tdc">198</td>
      <td class="tdc">18&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 2</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">981</td>
      <td class="tdc">189</td>
      <td class="tdc">792</td>
      <td class="tdc">72&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 8</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Thus, the figures in the last column (1, 2, 8) indicate the difference
between the two transposed figures in the correct item. Instead of
dropping the middle figure of the difference and dividing by 9 as
above, the entire difference figure may be divided by 99 with the same
result.</p>

<p>(d) Similarly, when the difference is 999 or a four-figure amount with
two 9’s in the middle, a three-column transposition may be indicated
thereby. For instance:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <thead><tr>
      <th class="tdc">Correct<br /> Number </th>
      <th class="tdc"> Transposed <br />Number</th>
      <th class="tdc">  Difference</th>
      <th class="tdc"> </th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc">5,174</td>
      <td class="tdc">4,175</td>
      <td class="tdc">0,999</td>
      <td class="tdc">09 divided by 9 = 1</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">6,392</td>
      <td class="tdc">2,396</td>
      <td class="tdc">3,996</td>
      <td class="tdc">36&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 4</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">7,081</td>
      <td class="tdc">1,087</td>
      <td class="tdc">5,994</td>
      <td class="tdc">54&emsp;”&emsp;   ”   9 = 6</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">the figures in the last column (1, 4, 6) again
indicating the difference between the transposed figures in the
original.</p>

<p>Instead of dividing the number formed by the outside digits
(9, 36, 54) by 9, we might divide the full amount of the difference
(999, 3,996, 5,994) by 999; this would give the same result.</p>

<p>The reason for the divisibility of this difference by 999 in an
error of this kind is apparent when a number is given algebraic
notation instead of Arabic. The Arabic number 2,197 expressed
algebraically would be 2,000 + 100 + 90 + 7. Generalizing, we
may formulate any number of four figures by 1,000a + 100b + 10c + d,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
in which a, b, c, and d may have values from 0 to 9 inclusive.
A transposition between the thousands and units digits, the “a” and the
“d,” would result in the following number: 1,000d + 100b + 10c + a. The
error would therefore be:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Original number</td>
      <td class="tdr">1,000a</td>
      <td class="tdl"> + 100b + 10c + d</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">Transposed number&emsp; </td>
      <td class="tdr bb">a</td>
      <td class="tdl bb"> + 100b + 10c + 1,000d</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl_ws1">Difference</td>
      <td class="tdr">999a</td>
      <td class="tdr">-&emsp;999d</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">This error is plainly divisible by 999, and the
resulting quotient (a-d) is the difference between the two transposed
digits.</p>

<p>It may be shown similarly why 99 is a divisor of the error cited under
case (c) above.</p>

<p><b>Transplacements.</b>—A transplacement or slide occurs when some
or all of the digits of a number are moved one or more places to the
right or left without change in the order of the figures; for instance,
736 written as 73.60, as 7.36, or as 700.36. The first is called a
one-column slide, the second and third two-column slides. The error
caused by a one-column slide is always divisible by 9, a two-column
by 99, a three-column by 999, etc. The division by 9, 99, 999, etc.,
disregarding decimals, always gives the figures whose transplacement
has caused the error. Thus the error caused by writing 736 as 73.60
is 662.40, which divided by 9 is 736; or 736 written as 7.36 produces
an error of 728.64, which divided by 99 gives 736; or 736 written as
700.36 causes an error of 35.64, which divided by 99 gives 36, the
part transplaced. The reason is similar to that given above for the
transposition.</p>

<p>When a whole number of dollars is written as cents, the resulting error
is divisible by 9 and moreover the cents <i>added to</i> the dollars
gives 99 in each case. For instance in writing:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc">.73</td>
      <td class="tdc"> instead of </td>
      <td class="tdc">73.00,</td>
      <td class="tdc"> the resulting error is </td>
      <td class="tdc">72.27</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">.58</td>
      <td class="tdc">    ”  &emsp;” </td>
      <td class="tdc">58.00,</td>
      <td class="tdl">   ”<span class="ws2">”</span><span class="ws3">”</span>  ”</td>
      <td class="tdc">57.42</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">.16</td>
      <td class="tdc">    ”  &emsp;” </td>
      <td class="tdc">16.00,</td>
      <td class="tdl">   ”<span class="ws2">”</span><span class="ws3">”</span>  ”</td>
      <td class="tdc">15.84</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="5"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>When the error in the trial balance is of this kind, the amount
transplaced may be found by subtracting the cents of the error
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
from 100. In the above examples this difference would be 100-27, 100
-42, 100-84, or 73, 58, and 16 respectively, which are in each case
the figures of the transplaced amount as seen in the example. Having
determined this, the trial balance and ledger accounts should be gone
over to look for a slide of the given number.</p>

<p><b>Checking the Postings.</b>—From the above discussion, the
impossibility of determining in all cases the nature of the error
is quite evident—particularly as to whether it is one caused by
a transposition or a slide. Unless the kind of error is readily
discernible, it is usually advisable to employ the method of
checking, i.e., going over all the work of posting to determine its
correctness—or other methods to be discussed in <a href="#Page_477">Chapter LI</a>.
After all, careful work in making the record with legible figures and in
proving additions and subtractions, wherever possible, more than pays
for itself in the time saved hunting for errors caused by slovenly and
inaccurate work.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE CLASSIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Accounting Routine Related to Account Classification.</b>—The basic
relationships between the accounts and the statements of financial
condition were explained in <a href="#Page_72">Chapter IX</a>, where
a chart of accounts was given to illustrate the fundamental equation of
the ledger. The complete record-making routine, comprising the use of
business papers for memorandum entry, the use of the journals for the
first formal record of transactions, and the use of the ledger for the
classified entry, has now been explained. There remain, however, two
classes of entries, the adjusting and closing, whose relationship to
the journal-ledger routine has not yet been fully discussed although
their relationship to each record has been separately considered. Since
the closing of the books contemplates the drawing up of financial
statements and since all record-keeping must have in view from the
very beginning a proper classification of accounts giving the desired
information to be reflected finally in the statements, it seems best
at this point to consider some phases of account classification before
proceeding with a detailed explanation of the method used in adjusting
and closing the books.</p>

<p><b>The Need for Classification.</b>—As explained in preceding
chapters, accounts may be broadly classified into the three main
divisions of assets, liabilities, and proprietorship. This threefold
division, however, is inadequate for the purpose of presenting detailed
information as to the kinds of assets owned by the proprietor, the
nature of his liabilities, and the causes that have produced increases
or decreases of proprietorship. Subdivisions of the three main groups
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
must, therefore, be made, the minuteness of subdivision being
determined by the amount of detailed information desired.</p>

<p>One of the main purposes of account-keeping is to summarize results on
the financial statements. The items which appear on these statements
represent the balances of one or more groups of accounts. Items, for
instance, such as “Land” and “Buildings,” may each represent a single
ledger account recording the value of the land, the factory, and the
office buildings respectively; whereas the item “Accounts Receivable”
represents the group of customers’ accounts, the number of which may
run into the hundreds and even thousands and which may be kept in
a ledger devoted exclusively to the recording of their detail. The
reasons for grouping assets and liabilities on the basis of degree of
liquidity, and the advantages resulting from such grouping when drawing
up the summary statements of the period, were discussed and illustrated
in <a href="#Page_22">Chapter III</a>.</p>

<p>It is evident from the above that the classification or grouping of the
ledger accounts is reflected in the items on the financial statements;
and that, conversely, the kind of information which it is desirable to
present on the statements will to a large extent govern the groupings
in the ledger. This dependence of the account titles and groupings in
the ledger upon the end and aim in view makes it necessary to draw
up the original classification with great care. To aid in securing a
record correct in the first instance, certain fundamental groupings or
classification of accounts must always be made.</p>

<p><b>Basic Classification.</b>—While other groupings of accounts have
been made, the classification used here has been from the beginning a
three-phase one, consisting of an asset, liability, and proprietorship
nomenclature. The third group of accounts, proprietorship, is further
divided into the two subclasses, temporary and vested, as explained in
<a href="#Page_91">Chapter XII</a>. At the end of the fiscal period,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
after the ledger has been closed, there appear only asset, liability,
and vested proprietorship accounts; but during the fiscal period, the
temporary proprietorship accounts come into being and certain asset and
liability accounts take on a mixed character resulting from the method
in which the record is kept. This method is dictated not by a pure
accounting theory, but by a theory designed to accommodate itself to
the practical requirements of the average business. It is because the
practical method of making the record falls short of the theoretically
exact method, that adjustments must be made before summarizing.</p>

<p>For this reason, a record is not made daily of the portion of
assets which has been consumed each day, but the asset accounts are
adjusted at the close of each fiscal period to separate their asset
and proprietorship elements. Also, when a note is discounted at
the bank, its entire face value is set up as a liability. From the
standpoint of accurate accounting, however, the face value of the
note overstates the liability for the current fiscal period, if the
note falls due in the following period, by the amount of the prepaid
interest charge belonging to that next period. Only on the due date
of the note does the record show the true condition of the liability.
Thus, a “practical” method of keeping the record necessitates the use
of certain “mixed” accounts. Fundamentally, however, the three-group
classification given answers every necessary purpose.</p>

<p><b>Fundamentals of a Good Classification.</b>—In judging the fitness
of a particular classification, the end and purpose for which it is
made must always be the criterion. Any classification of accounts
must, therefore, have in view the fact that all accounts lead up to
the balance sheet and profit and loss statement, and that they must
provide the data necessary for the summaries of these statements.
Classifications may be made from many different viewpoints and for
many different purposes, but a classification which is logical and
carries titles clearly indicating the purpose for which the accounts
are intended, and which therefore needs little or no explanation, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
a satisfactory classification. The three-group classification—assets,
liabilities, and proprietorship—meets these requirements.</p>

<p>A two-group classification—real and nominal—is frequently used.
Under this classification, asset and liability accounts are grouped as
real, and proprietorship accounts comprise the nominal class. This is
the standard classification. The student should be familiar with it,
although the meaning of the groups is not so apparent as in the case
of the three-group classification, referred to above.</p>

<p><b>Classifying Business Transactions.</b>—When making the record
of business transactions on the books of account, it is necessary,
first, to determine the main account group or groups affected by the
transaction. After this is done, it is usually easy to determine which
particular account in the group is affected. Great care must be used
in the determination of the main groups, since a wrong classification
results in an incorrect showing in the summary statements at the close
of the fiscal period.</p>

<p>To illustrate, in <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a> reference was
made to the fundamental distinction between capital and revenue
expenditures. When making the original entry of some transactions this
difference is frequently lost sight of and what should be charged to an
asset account is charged to some expense account or vice versa. This
charging to an asset account, of items which are rightly expense items
and therefore cut down the proprietorship element of the business, is
one of the easiest ways of inflating the profits for a period and so
of making a better showing than would be the case if the facts were
recorded correctly.</p>

<p>Correct classification of transactions is a matter of vital importance.
An accurate analysis of every transaction must therefore be made before
bringing it on the books. After determining the <i>main</i> group of
accounts in which record is to be made, further analysis as indicated
above is necessary in order to fit a particular transaction into its
place under a suitable <i>account</i> title belonging to the main group.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p><b>Detailed Classification.</b>—In dealing with account
classification, the more detailed groupings must also be considered.
Such consideration deals, (1) with account titles in detail and even
with the kinds and classes of transactions to be recorded under
particular titles, and (2) with the arrangement and use of these
detailed accounts in the various sections of the summary statements at
the close of the fiscal period. Certain broad principles have already
been laid down which are to be followed in the selection of the account
title, and the objection to the inclusion of unlike items under the
same title, and the care to be exercised against a more detailed
analysis than is required by the needs of the business, have also been
explained. That system of accounts which groups only one kind of data
under each particular account title is better than a system which
mixes its records by grouping dissimilar data under a single head.
Yet, caution is always to be exercised against too great detail and an
unnecessary multiplication of accounts. Oftentimes essential facts and
forces of business activity are lost sight of in a maze of detail.</p>

<p>Below is given a somewhat detailed classification of accounts in
accordance with the two considerations stated above. No attempt is
made at completeness; only the more usual titles are presented. This
classification will be used throughout the rest of the volume.

<p><b>Method of Arranging Accounts in the Ledger.</b>—As to the order of
arrangement of accounts in the ledger, one principle governs: Arrange
all accounts in such a manner as to facilitate the drawing up of the
final statements. Thus, assets should come first, arranged in the
degree of their liquidity or availability, and each valuation account
following its particular asset. Liabilities, coming as they do after
the asset accounts, should be arranged in a similar order. Next should
come the proprietor’s accounts, the summary Profit and Loss account,
and the income and expense accounts in the order in which they are to
be used in the statement of profit and loss. Where only one ledger is
kept, the personal accounts receivable and payable are usually recorded
in distinct groups, after all the other accounts, towards the back part
of the ledger rather than in the position required by the principle
just stated.</p>

<p>A trial balance taken from a ledger in which the order of arrangement
of the accounts is strictly in accordance with this principle, is
called a “classified trial balance.”</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE WORK SHEET AND<br /> SUMMARY STATEMENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Procedure Preliminary to Adjusting and Closing.</b>—Before tracing
the detail of the adjusting and closing entries through the books,
explanation will be given of the usual method of insuring the accuracy
of this periodic work preliminary to the formal closing of the books.
This preliminary work comprises the technical procedure employed in
drawing up the balance sheet and profit and loss statement before
the books are closed. It thus brings about a summarization of the
period’s results made <i>outside</i> the books instead of <i>in</i>
them. Therefore, a proof of the accuracy and correctness of the work of
adjusting and closing can be secured before the summarization entries
are made in the books. After proof of accuracy has thus been secured,
the statements are used as a guide in making the formal adjusting and
closing entries.</p>

<p>The information for the balance sheet and profit and loss statements
comes mostly from the regular monthly trial balance taken at the end
of the period just <i>before</i> the adjusting entries are made. This
trial balance must of course be modified in order to include the effect
of the adjustments. For the purpose of incorporating the adjustments
in the trial balance and then separating the accounts into the two
groups, namely, those which are to be summarized in the profit and
loss statement and those which are to be used for the balance sheet, a
regular form is used known as the accountant’s “work sheet.” This form
and the method of its use will now be explained.</p>

<p><b>The Work Sheet.</b>—For the work sheet “analysis” paper is used,
which is ruled in its simple form as shown in the illustration on
<a href="#Page_226">pages 226 and 227</a>, space being provided for:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">1. Account titles</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Trial balance items</li>
<li class="isub2">3. Adjustment items</li>
<li class="isub2">4. Profit and loss items</li>
<li class="isub2">5. Balance sheet items</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">For the purpose of illustration, a trial balance
and a list of adjustments are given below, followed by the work sheet
and the necessary explanatory detail.</p>

<p>The student must understand that the work sheet is no part of the
formal accounting record, nor is the procedure employed by it a part
of the formal work of closing the books. It is only a means by which a
rough summarization of the period’s results may be made <i>outside</i>
the regular accounting records and all the data needed for the formal
statements be brought together. Its purpose is to secure and prove
the accuracy of results before the formal adjusting and closing work
is entered on the books. Where many or complicated adjustments are to
be made, with a resulting probability of error and difficulty in an
orderly arrangement of the adjusting entries, the method of the work
sheet is almost indispensable. The formal adjusting entries are then
made up from the adjustment columns of the work sheet.</p>

<p>The initial step in the use of the work sheet is to enter the trial
balance in the first two columns, as shown on <a href="#Page_226">pages 226, 227</a>.
The accounts in the trial balance should be arranged in classified form
before being entered on the work sheet, as this aids greatly in
drawing up the statements. The various adjustment entries, debit and
credit, which are almost the same as in the ledger, are then entered
in the adjustment columns. The work sheet may be looked upon somewhat
as a ledger, entries in whose accounts are to be made horizontally
instead of vertically. The analogy to the ledger cannot be carried
too far, however. It should be noted that when it is necessary to
adjust any account in the trial balance by increasing its debit, this
is accomplished by entering the item in the debit adjustment column
on the same line with the account to be adjusted. On the other hand,
if a subtraction is to be made from a debit amount shown in the trial
balance, the amount to be deducted is entered in the credit adjustment
column. A complete debit and credit entry must be made in the
adjustment columns for each adjustment.</p>

<p>There is given below a debit and credit <i>list</i> of these entries
as they are to appear on the work sheet. The manner of making
and cross-indexing these adjustment entries is indicated by the
cross-reference letters used. It will be noted that, while in most
instances these entries are exactly the same as the formal adjusting
journal entries, there is a difference in the case of the merchandise
inventories.</p>

<p>The student should understand that the <i>list</i> of adjustment
entries given below does not appear anywhere in the formal accounting
records. It is shown here in <i>journal form</i> only to indicate the
debits and credits of the entries to the work sheet. Entries of the
adjustment transactions are always made direct to the work sheet, never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
being set up in journal form. Each of these entries should be traced
into the adjustment columns of the work sheet. The figures in
parentheses just preceding the debit and credit amounts are, of course,
not <i>ledger folios</i> but refer to the similarly numbered items on the
work sheet so that the student will have no difficulty in tracing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
In order to set up some of these adjusting entries, it becomes
necessary to add some new accounts on the work sheet. The student will
note these appended at the end of the regular trial balance shown on
the work sheet. They are, first, Bad Debts and Depreciation, under the
latter of which the detail of the fixed assets subject to depreciation
is given, and then follow in order the balance sheet classifications
of Accrued Income, Deferred Charges to Operation, Accrued Expenses,
and Deferred Income, provision being made to show under each of these
titles the detail of the accounts involved.</p>

<p>It will be noted that some of the adjusting entries are not set up
in the adjustment columns in exact accord with the way in which the
same items are entered on the ledger, but rather in accord with the
use to be made of the particular items in drawing up the periodic
statements. The purpose of the columns is not to make the adjustments
and summarization in a formal manner as is done in the books, but to
gather together all the adjusting data so that a correct separation
of the balance sheet and profit and loss items can be made for use
in the formal summary entries and in the statements. Thus, instead
of transferring the initial inventory to the Purchases account, it
is allowed to remain under its own title, because it will be needed
as a separate item in drawing up the cost-of-goods-sold section of
the profit and loss statement. Similarly, the final inventory is not
shown deducted from Purchases, but is set up, debit and credit, in the
adjustment columns, opposite the title “Merchandise Inventory—Final,”
which is inserted immediately following the account “Merchandise
Inventory—Initial.” At the time of summarizing, the debit item goes
into the balance sheet, while the credit item goes into profit and
loss. This method of handling provides in the profit and loss columns
the detailed information needed for the cost-of-goods-sold section of
the statement, comprising Initial Inventory, Purchases, In-Freight,
Purchases Returns and Allowances, and Final Inventory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>The bad debts adjustment is entered in the adjustment columns as a
debit to Bad Debts and a credit to Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.
Similarly, the depreciation entry is shown as a debit to Depreciation
in detail, the credits going to the various depreciation reserve
accounts.</p>

<p>The adjustments covering deferred charges are shown as debits to
the “Deferred Charges to Operation” classification in detail, the
offsetting credits being to the various expense accounts as shown in
the trial balance. These credits in the adjustment column will, when
combined with the corresponding debit in the trial balance column,
indicate the net amount of the charge to profit and loss. The other
classes of adjustment entries follow the same procedure.</p>

<p>After all adjustments have been made, a complete distribution of the
items in the trial balance and adjustment columns is made either to the
profit and loss or the balance sheet columns. The difference between
the profit and loss columns will thus show the net profit or loss for
the period and must be transferred to the balance sheet as a vested
proprietorship item. Instead of being shown as a definite addition
to the proprietor’s capital, the transfer is indicated as the final
item on the work sheet, being a debit in the profit and loss columns
to balance them, and a credit in the balance sheet columns. This
difference, $14,747.12 in our illustration, constitutes the net profit
for the period, and when added to the credit side of the balance sheet
columns should give a total equal to the total of the debit balance
sheet column. This transfer of net profit effects a proof of the
accuracy of the work.</p>

<p>When this proof has been secured, the formal profit and loss statement
should be drawn up, all of the material for which will be found in the
profit and loss columns of the work sheet, where it is arranged in
almost the exact order needed for the formal statement. The information
for the balance sheet is found similarly in the balance sheet columns,
all of the detail being properly grouped but a rearrangement of the
order of some items being necessary. Thus, while the detail of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
deferred charges to operation has been gathered together in one place
in the work sheet, in the formal balance sheet this group of items must
appear immediately after the current asset section. <a href="#Page_234">See page 234</a>
for the profit and loss statement and <a href="#Page_232">page 232</a>
for the balance sheet.</p>

<p>It is thus seen that the work sheet provides a convenient method of
passing through the trial balance the adjustments necessary to a
summarization of the results of the period and of effecting a rough
summarization of these results. The work sheet becomes the source of
information for the formal statements and a preliminary stage to the
adjustment and closing of the books.</p>

<p>The purpose of the formal adjusting entries and the manner of framing
them are fully explained in <a href="#Page_237">Chapter XXVIII</a>.
After the information on which they are based is brought together and
entered on the work sheet and after the work of summarization has been
proven, the adjustment columns of the work sheet are made the source
for these entries. The formal adjusting entries as they appear in the
journal are given on <a href="#Page_245">page 245</a>. They should be
compared with the debit and credit list for the work sheet as given
above and the differences noted.</p>

<p><b>Need for the Summary Statements.</b>—Before setting up the
formal journal entries necessary to adjust and close the books, the
balance sheet and statement of profit and loss will be shown. These
two periodic statements do not form an integral part of the books
of account. They are drawn up periodically and submitted to the
proprietor, because the latter does not always have ready access to the
books of account and often lacks sufficient knowledge of accounting to
interpret correctly the information shown by the journal and ledger.
The periodic statements are intended to show the results of the year in
a concise, non-technical form, so that a proprietor, even though not
versed in the science of accounts, can readily understand them.</p>

<p><b>The Two Forms of Balance Sheet.</b>—The balance sheet may be
arranged in either of two forms. The first form (illustrated on <a href="#Page_232">page 232)</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
follows the principles already laid down in <a href="#Page_22">Chapter III</a>.
This is called the “report form” and is based on the proprietorship
equation when written</p>

<p class="f110">Assets - Liabilities = Proprietorship</p>

<p class="no-indent">Being non-technical, it is perhaps more favored by
executives not versed in technical account-keeping.</p>

<p>The second form (<a href="#FORM_25">illustrated on page 233</a>)
follows the proprietorship equation when written</p>

<p class="f120">Assets = Liabilities + Proprietorship</p>

<p class="no-indent">This form shows financial condition by means of
the account form, the subtraction of the liabilities from the assets
being indicated by their respective debit and credit positions in the
account. It will be noticed, however, that this method of showing the
subtractions is not strictly adhered to, some deductions being actually
performed, as for instance in the case of the valuation reserves which
are subtracted from the respective assets to which they apply. This
is done in order to render the statement more intelligible. The same
principles govern the arrangement of the items and groups of items
as in the first form, viz., degree of liquidity for the assets and
a similar arrangement for the liabilities. The account form is used
almost always when the statement is submitted for publication.</p>

<p><b>Two Forms for the Profit and Loss Statement.</b>—The statement of
profit and loss is also made up in either of two forms, called the
report form and the account form, based on the same principles as the
two forms of balance sheet just discussed. Explanation of the report
form has already been given in Chapters <a href="#Page_38">V</a> and
<a href="#Page_44">VI</a>. The account form (<a href="#FORM_27">illustrated
on page 235</a>) is very nearly a transcript of the ledger Profit and
Loss account. It differs chiefly in that the information concerning
“sales” which is summarized in the Sales account on the ledger is
here set up in an inner column and shown summarized on the face of
the statement. The information as to cost of goods sold is similarly summarized.

<b>Interim Statements.</b>—In many businesses, where the fiscal
period is six months or a year, it is often desirable and important
that at least approximate results be secured at interim periods. This
can be accomplished by means of the work sheet without entailing the
burdensome work involved in a formal closing of the books. At the time
of the taking of any trial balance, the work sheet can be used as a
means of making the necessary adjustments before securing results as
to financial and operating condition. Accurate results would of course
require as careful work as at the end of the regular fiscal period. The
purpose of interim summaries is to indicate trends rather than to show
accurate and definite results. At such times, therefore, the inventory
is usually estimated, oftentimes the same amount being used as at
the beginning of the period. Accruals and deferred items are not so
carefully estimated nor in so great detail. Bad debts and depreciation
must be taken into account. In this way approximate results for any
period—frequently every month—may be secured without interfering with
those for the regular fiscal period.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">ADJUSTING AND CLOSING<br /> THE BOOKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Adjustment Entries—Kinds and Place of Record.</b>—In <a href="#Page_115">Chapter XV</a>
it was shown that the records as they are usually kept do not reflect
the true condition of the business at any time <i>during</i> the
fiscal period. For this reason before summarizing the book record for
the current period it is necessary to bring onto the books a number
of entries the purpose of which is to “adjust” the mixed accounts and
thus make the ledger reflect the true condition. These adjustments
may be effected by entry made directly on the face of the ledger, but
it is better to run them through the journal, thus making it possible
to give ample explanation. A further advantage of first recording the
adjustment entries in the journal is that in this way all such entries
appear in one place in the books of account. The ledger should always
be kept as a book of <i>secondary</i> entry, with supporting data in
some book of <i>original</i> entry.</p>

<p>Seven types of adjustment entries are needed for the ledger of a
mercantile concern. They are:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">1. Merchandise Inventory</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Depreciation</li>
<li class="isub2">3. Bad Debts</li>
<li class="isub2">4. Accrued Income</li>
<li class="isub2">5. Deferred Expenses</li>
<li class="isub2">6. Accrued Expenses</li>
<li class="isub2">7. Deferred Income</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">All such items must be given consideration and
entered upon the books before the final results for the period can be
correctly shown. It is oftentimes necessary to make correcting entries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
for items the improper entry or the omission of which are not
detected until the close of the fiscal period. These errors, whenever
discovered, should of course be corrected at once. Because entries of
this kind are in the nature of adjusting entries, consideration of them
is included in this chapter.</p>

<p>It may be observed here that if a business manager has an intelligent
insight into the development of his enterprise, and carefully watches
the volume of sales, purchases, and expenses, he may be able to
forecast with some degree of accuracy the approximate results for a
given period; but only by making the actual count of stock now on hand
and by carefully estimating the classes of items just mentioned, can
accurate and dependable results be assured.</p>

<p>All these types of adjustment entries are not always found in every
such business, however. Each type will be discussed in turn.</p>

<p><b>Inventory of Stock-in-Trade.</b>—One of the most important
adjustment entries is that by which the inventory of stock-in-trade is
set up separately on the books. By reference to <a href="#Page_97">Chapter XIII</a>
it will be seen that none of the accounts connected with merchandise, viz.,
purchases, sales, returns, etc., contain any definite and up-to-date
information as to the value of merchandise on hand. To determine the
gross profit on sales this value must be known, and until the gross
profit is determined the net profit cannot be ascertained. The balance
sheet, the statement of profit and loss, and the Profit and Loss
account, call for this information. Therefore, before these statements
are made, and before the books can be closed, the value of goods on
hand must be determined. The process by which this is done is called
“inventory-taking.”</p>

<p>Without discussing the detail of a system of inventory-taking, three
fundamental principles can be stated relative thereto: <span
class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"> <p class="neg-indent">1. Make sure that
all goods belonging to the firm on the date of the inventory are
included.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Make equally sure that there is no duplication
of count, i.e., that no goods are counted twice.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. See that the condition of the goods, viewed
from the standpoint of salability, is indicated.</p>
</div>

<p>Two factors of importance enter into the determination of the
inventory, viz., the quantity of the goods on hand and their value per
unit. Inaccuracy in either factor may lead to a gross error in the
final amount. By falsifying the count of the goods the inventory can,
of course, be inflated. A usual and more elusive method, often resorted
to, consists in raising the price per unit, since the addition of
even a fraction of a cent per unit may have the effect of converting
an actual loss into an apparent profit. Without further indication of
the reason for such valuation, it is now generally required that the
inventory be valued on the basis of cost, or market if market is lower
than cost. The term “cost” should include all costs, incurred up to the
point of placing the goods in condition ready for sale, not only the
purchase price, but also duties, freight, drayage, insurance during transit, etc.</p>

<p>After the amount of the inventory has been determined, it is placed
on the books. However, before this is done it is necessary that the
Merchandise Inventory account be cleared of the goods on hand at the
<i>beginning</i> of the period by transferring the amount to Purchases.
The following journal entry effects the transfer:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Purchases</li>
<li class="isub5">Merchandise Inventory</li>
<li class="isub6">To transfer the opening inventory</li>
<li class="isub6">to Purchases.</li>
</ul>

<p>The posting of this entry automatically clears the Inventory account
and, by its addition to Purchases, causes that account to show the
“total goods to be accounted for.” Purchases, as it now stands,
contains both the cost of goods which have been sold during the current
period and those which are still on hand as shown by the inventory just
taken. Accordingly, to separate the two items, the following journal
entry is necessary:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Merchandise Inventory</li>
<li class="isub5">Purchases</li>
<li class="isub6">To set up the inventory of</li>
<li class="isub6">goods now on hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>This entry when posted shows in the Merchandise Inventory account the
asset element, and leaves in the Purchases account the cost of the
merchandise sold. The effect of these two entries, then, is to adjust
the books to true conditions so far as the merchandise is concerned.</p>

<p><b>Depreciation, and Loss on Doubtful Accounts.</b>—As indicated in
<a href="#Page_115">Chapter XV</a>, the amount of depreciation of particular
assets and the losses due to bad and doubtful accounts are carefully
estimated at the close of the fiscal period. The individual
depreciation items are all summarized in a <i>single</i> depreciation
account—an <i>expense</i> account—whose total debit is closed out to
Profit and Loss. The <i>depreciation reserves</i>, however, which are
credit items, are handled under separate account titles, and constitute
the valuation account of the corresponding assets. The journal entry
covering depreciation reads as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Depreciation</li>
<li class="isub5">Depreciation Reserve Buildings</li>
<li class="isub5">Depreciation Reserve Furniture and Fixtures</li>
<li class="isub5">Depreciation Reserve Delivery Equipment</li>
<li class="isub5">Depreciation Reserve Machinery</li>
</ul>

<p>The Reserve for Doubtful Accounts is the valuation account of Accounts
and Notes Receivable. Assume, for instance, that the debit balances of
the latter two accounts are $15,900, and the credit balance of their
valuation account is $600. The difference between these two accounts,
viz., $15,300, represents the present estimated value of Accounts and
Notes Receivable. The journal entry made <i>periodically</i> to record
the estimated loss from uncollectible items is:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Bad Debts</li>
<li class="isub5">Reserve for Doubtful Accounts</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
When the two entries above, for estimated depreciation and bad debts,
are posted, the present appraised values of those particular assets
are brought on the ledger; i.e., from the values, as shown by the
respective asset accounts, are taken the portions estimated to have
been used up, lost through depreciation, or uncollectible. These lost
portions are set up as expense items, leaving in the adjusted asset
accounts true asset values as existing at the close of the period.</p>

<p><b>Accrued Income.</b>—As to the asset portion of items of this
kind, it is indicated in the account in a manner similar to deferred
expenses, as explained on <a href="#Page_242">page 242</a>. Take the case
of interest income earned but not due. The entry for adjusting it is:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Interest Income (Accrued)</li>
<li class="isub5">Interest Income</li>
</ul>

<p>The credit part is posted immediately, thereby showing an addition
to the income already recorded as earned during the current period.
The debit part is posted after the current account is adjusted and
allowance made for the closing transfer entry to Profit and Loss. The
debit part of the adjusting entry is then entered on the debit side of
the <i>new</i> portion of the account. Assume this debit item to be
$50, and the interest received during the next period to be $170. The
new account will indicate a <i>credit balance</i> of $120, which is the
amount actually earned during that period, since the previous period
took credit for the $50 accrued or earned during <i>that</i> period.</p>

<p><b>Deferred Expenses.</b>—When a part of the expense paid during the
current period applies to the next period, the prepaid portion must be
taken out of the current expenses and held over—deferred—as a charge
to the expenses of the next period. Taking insurance as an example, the
following journal entry effects the required adjustment:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Insurance (Deferred)</li>
<li class="isub5">Insurance</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
In posting this entry, the credit part is posted first in order to take
out of the excessive cost shown chargeable to this period the portion
equitably belonging to the next period. When this is done, the <i>debit
balance</i> of the Insurance account indicates the amount to be charged
to the current period and is the correct charge against the Profit and
Loss for the period. After making allowance for the space needed for
closing the account, the debit side of the above entry is posted, this
debit becoming the first charge in the account for the next period.
Note that the use of the bracketed “Deferred” is as a guide in posting.
It indicates that that portion of the entry is not to be posted until
provision has been made for closing the account. After posting is
completed, the Insurance account appears as follows:</p>

</table>

<p class="no-indent">There remains, of course, the transfer to Profit
and Loss of the current balance before the account is <i>closed</i>.
This closing work is treated later in the chapter.</p>

<p><b>Accrued Expense Items.</b>—These items cover expenses which the
business has incurred but has not yet paid, and which are properly
chargeable to this period but have not yet been charged on the books.
For instance, salaries earned up to the close of the period but not
paid at its close constitute an additional charge to the period’s
operations which must be entered on the books before they will show
true conditions. This amount also constitutes a liability of the
business. Accordingly, the journal entry is:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Salaries</li>
<li class="isub5">Salaries (Accrued)</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
thus charging the Salaries account with the amount due but not paid,
and bringing this amount down as a credit balance to the new account
for the next period. Assuming this unpaid amount to be $72, the account
after closing will show this $72 as a liability on the <i>closing
date</i>. Its effect, however, during the next period will be to
<i>reduce</i> the amount charged to salaries during that period,
because this $72, although paid during that period, has already been
charged to the previous period.</p>

<p>The credit to Salaries, therefore, serves two purposes, viz., that of
showing the outstanding liability at the <i>close</i> of the current
period, and that of effecting a reduction of what would be, without
this credit, an overcharge to <i>next</i> period’s salaries. For
example, if the total salary paid during the next period is $600,
the <i>balance</i> of $528 is the amount applicable to that period,
although the amount actually paid is $600.</p>

<p><b>Deferred Income.</b>—Income received by the business during the
present period which, however, belongs to the subsequent period is
called “deferred income,” as for instance, rent received in advance
from a tenant. As to the liability portion of items of this kind, it
is indicated in a manner similar to the accrued expense items. In this
case the journal entry is:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Rent Income</li>
<li class="isub5">Rent Income (Deferred)</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">the effect being to decrease the amount of rent
income for the current period and to show the portion belonging to the
next period deferred to that period’s account.</p>

<p><b>Corrections.</b>—When an error has been made in any entry on the
books, it should not be erased or scratched out, because by so doing
suspicion may be raised as to what was expunged. The wrong item should
be ruled out and the correct item written above it or wherever it
belongs. This applies particularly to books of original entry whose use
as evidence has often been destroyed because many erasures appeared in them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>Another way of making a correction, when an amount has been posted to a
wrong account, is first to cancel the wrong posting through a similar
entry on the <i>other side</i> of the same account, and then to post it to
the correct account. Cross-reference to the two accounts must be made.</p>

<p>When an amount has been posted to the <i>wrong side</i> of <i>the
correct account</i>, e.g., $100 to the credit side of John Doe’s
account, when it should have been posted to the debit side, the
incorrect credit may be canceled by a debit of $100, and after this the
original $100 should be entered on the debit side; or the cancellation
and correction may be combined by entering $200 on the debit side.
Better still, the incorrect posting may be ruled out and a correct
posting made of the <i>original entry</i> whose wrong posting caused
the error. Adequate cross-reference should be given so as to make the
tracing of the items easy and to indicate exactly what was done.</p>

<p>As these entries are of a somewhat unusual nature, their exact purpose
should be plainly indicated in the explanation columns. According to
the methods mentioned above, the various correcting entries are made
directly on the face of the ledger. It is often preferable, however,
first to make the required correction entries in the journal with full
explanation, and then to post them to the ledger.</p>

<p><b>Adjusting Entries Illustrated.</b>—In order to indicate clearly
the routine and method to be followed in summarizing the books at the
close of the fiscal period, the formal adjusting and closing journal
entries needed for the books of U. R. Smart will now be set up, the
illustrative data being the same as were used for the work sheet in
<a href="#Page_221">Chapter XXVII</a> to which reference should be made.
In connection with the work sheet it was stated that the adjustment
columns of the work sheet are used as a guide to making the adjusting
entries. As to sequence in the journal, these follow immediately,
without break, the last current entry for the month. The adjusting
entries for U. R. Smart are:

<p><b>Purpose of Summarizing.</b>—After the adjusting entries are posted,
the ledger reflects the true financial condition as of the date of
these entries. However, at this stage the information contained in the
ledger is usually scattered over a large number of accounts. To obtain
a concise view of the results of the business, it is necessary to
summarize this information. The Profit and Loss <i>account</i> is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
means by which the temporary proprietorship accounts are summarized and
the net results as to profits or losses are indicated.</p>

<p>In this connection it will be remembered that the adjusting entries
have already effected a separation of the elements of the mixed
accounts, so that the temporary proprietorship items—expenses and
income—applicable to the current period are now separately shown.
The transfer of these <i>temporary</i> proprietorship items to the
<i>vested</i> proprietorship accounts constitutes the work of closing.
The use of the Profit and Loss account as a place of summary—a
clearing house—through which the <i>net</i> result can be passed on or
transferred to the vested proprietorship accounts, constitutes a part
of the method or technique of closing.</p>

<p><b>The Closing Entries.</b>—The student is already familiar with the
principles of debit and credit involved in making the closing entries.
As indicated above, these are transfer entries and merely effect a
transfer of all temporary proprietorship items to the Profit and Loss
account for summary there and for the transfer of the net result to
some vested proprietorship account or accounts. Like all other entries,
these are made first in the journal and are posted from there to the
ledger. The current sections of the various expense and income accounts
are then ruled off and the ledger is said to be “closed.”</p>

<p><b>Method of Closing the Books.</b>—As explained on <a href="#Page_129">page 129</a>,
the Profit and Loss account in the ledger is used for summarizing the
temporary proprietorship accounts before transferring them, i.e.,
their net result, to the vested proprietorship accounts. The use
of Purchases and Sales accounts for a partial summarization of the
various merchandise accounts has also been explained. After this
partial summarization has been made, the debit balance of the Purchases
account, showing cost of goods sold, is transferred to the Profit and
Loss account; and similarly, the credit balance of the Sales account,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
representing net sales, is transferred to the Profit and Loss account.
Profit and Loss then shows on the credit side net sales and on the
debit cost of goods sold, the difference being the income portion,
i.e., the gross profit of the merchandising activities for the period.
If it is desired to show on the face of the account the actual figure
of gross profit, the Profit and Loss account may be balanced at this
stage, though this is not usually done. The rest of the work of
summarization is accomplished directly through the Profit and Loss account.</p>

<p><b>Closing Entries Illustrated.</b>—The formal journal entries
necessary to effect this summarization in the ledger are given below,
being based on the illustration used for the work sheet and being made
up directly from the various sections of the formal profit and loss
statement shown on <a href="#Page_234">page 234</a>. The way in which
this is done should be carefully noted. As to their sequence in the
journal, these closing entries will, of course, immediately follow the
formal adjusting entries illustrated above.</p>

<p class="space-above2">It will be noted that after the net sales and
cost of goods sold are transferred to the Profit and Loss account, all
expenses directly connected with sales, such as Salesmen’s Salaries,
Advertising, Delivery Expense, Depreciation of Delivery Equipment, of
Store Furniture and Fixtures, and similar items, are closed into the
Profit and Loss account.</p>

<p>The groups of accounts closed next are those covering General
Administrative Expenses, Financial Management Expenses, Financial
Management Income, Non-Operating Expense, and Non-Operating Income. It
will be noticed that the <i>order</i> of closing follows the order in
which the same items appear in the profit and loss statement.</p>

<p>The Profit and Loss account now shows on the credit side the items
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
of income and on the debit side the costs and expenses applicable to
the current period. Its balance then gives the net profit (or loss)
covering the period’s transactions.</p>

<p>Throughout the period, as the profit accrues, the proprietor may have
drawn against it for personal use, as shown in his Personal account.
To show the amount of profit remaining in the business, the balance of
the Profit and Loss account is transferred to the Personal account, the
balance of which then gives the amount of undrawn or overdrawn profit.
The balance of the Personal account is closed into the Capital account,
the credit balance of which then represents the net worth of the
business at the end of this period and at the commencement of the next.</p>

<p><b>The Profit and Loss Account.</b>—In posting the closing journal
entries to the Profit and Loss account in the ledger, usually only
the group totals as indicated by the entry will appear. In small
concerns where expenses and income are not classified in much detail,
the individual items composing the group total are often shown. These
items are, of course, the same as appear in the part of the journal
entry which is contra to the group total charged or credited to Profit
and Loss. The ledger Profit and Loss account for the illustration will
appear as follows when completely posted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
<b>Profit and Loss Not an Account for Current Entry.</b>—It should
be kept clearly in mind that the process of closing the books is
merely a method or device by which the transactions for the year are
<i>summarized</i> and the net result determined. This net result,
whether a profit or a loss, belongs to the proprietor and must
ultimately be shown in his account. It is, therefore, manifest that
the Profit and Loss account is <i>only</i> a summary account and
should never be used for current entry. It is the means by which the
<i>temporary</i> proprietorship accounts are summarized and the medium
through which the net result is cleared into some vested proprietorship
account or accounts.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Closing the Ledger.</b>—The transfer of net profit to a
vested proprietorship account completes the work of closing the ledger,
all temporary proprietorship accounts for the <i>current</i> period
being closed out. All open balances now shown on the ledger constitute
either assets, liabilities, or vested proprietorship. A post-closing
trial balance contains only the accounts shown on the corresponding
balance sheet. The income and expense accounts, having been cleared
of their current record, are prepared to receive the record of the
next period. The business cycle for this particular business has been
completed and its correct history recorded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">TYPES OF ACCOUNTING RECORDS AND<br />
THEIR DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Evolution of Analytical Journals.</b>—Though the only books
absolutely necessary for an accounting record under the double-entry
method are the journal and the ledger, even the small business finds
some subdivision of the journals advantageous, and so makes use of
sales, purchases, and cash receipts and cash disbursements journals.
As a business grows and its transactions increase in volume and
complexity, further subdivision is needed. When the scope of its
organization becomes too great for a personal oversight, a method or
system must be devised for keeping the proprietor or manager in close
touch with the various departments and lines of business endeavor. This
is accomplished by means of reports from the accounting department,
which exists largely for the purpose of furnishing this kind of
information.</p>

<p><b>Principle to be Followed in Securing Analysis.</b>—In an
earlier chapter it was laid down as a fundamental principle that
the information desired by the management should be furnished from
analytical records made at the time of original entry, rather than by
analyzing a composite record at the time the information is wanted.
Such analytical records make possible a quicker and more up-to-date
report to the management, and they save labor in securing the
information by making the analysis at the time of record when all the
facts related to it are readily available.</p>

<p><b>Types of Sales Journals and Methods of Handling.</b>—The first
step in the analysis of business transactions is the subdivision of the
general journal into separate journals, and this analysis is carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
still further by the use of columnar journal records. Reference has
already been made, in <a href="#Page_139">Chapter XVIII</a>, to the
use of additional columns in the sales and purchase journals. Here a
brief sketch will be given of the methods of recording sales in various
kinds of sales journals.</p>

<p>1. The earliest type of sales journal, not often used today, consisted
of a letter impression book containing the press copy of invoices
sent to customers, with columns for the extension of the amounts and
sometimes with additional columns for purposes of analysis. Such a
journal has the advantage that the original entry is an exact copy of
the invoice. Oftentimes, however, the impression is poor and nearly
or quite illegible; it takes much room; the detail shown is not often
used; and it increases the work of making and handling the record.</p>

<p>2. Another method makes use of a perforated invoice book with a
columnized interleaf solid-bound between the perforated invoice sheets.
The sales invoice is written on one of the perforated sheets and a
carbon underneath gives a duplicate on the interleaf, the latter
constituting the formal sales record. The advantages and objections are
practically the same as for the impression book method.</p>

<p>3. Another method is to make a separate carbon copy of each invoice
and use the duplicate as the source of entry in the sales journal.
The journal entry gives only the file number of the duplicate invoice
so that in case of need the duplicate can easily be referred to. Such
a sales journal may, of course, contain analytical columns with any
desired heads.</p>

<p>4. Still another method uses the duplicate invoice for posting to the
customer’s account, after which it is filed in binders. The latter
are usually provided with recapitulation sheets which show the totals
and analysis for each day, week, or month as the case may be. Just as
above, the invoice file provides the detail in support of the ledger
account and the recapitulation sheets constitute the journal from which
credits to the various sales accounts are made. Either one of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
last two methods eliminates most of the objections and embraces most of
the advantages of the other methods mentioned above.</p>

<p>Where several sales ledgers are used, the sales journal is sometimes
subdivided on the same basis as an aid in posting and for the purpose
of securing controlling figures as explained in following chapters.</p>

<p><b>The Sales Returns and Allowances Journal.</b>—The use of any
special form of sales journal, particularly if it provides for an
analysis of the sales, requires a similar record of sales returns
and allowances. Either a separate book, similar in form to the sales
journal, may be employed for recording these items or the pages in the
back of the sales journal may be used instead.</p>

<p><b>Development of the Purchase Journal.</b>—The development of the
purchase records from the old-time scrapbook for invoices to the modern
analytic voucher record resembles the development of the sales journal.
The old-fashioned invoice book was usually a big, loose-bound, coarse
paper volume in which were pasted the invoices for goods bought. An
extension column was provided for the amount of the invoice, and the
total of this gave the purchases for a given period. The use of columns
for various classes of purchases provided the required analysis, but,
as it was a cumbersome, nondescript record, it was bound to give place
to something better&mdash;the formal purchase journal or register of today.</p>

<p>The purchase journal or register consists of a bound or a loose-leaf
book ruled to suit individual needs and purposes. Where sales are
analyzed by classes, an exactly similar analysis of purchases must be
made in order to secure a gross profit figure for each class. Therefore
its form follows very closely that of the sales journal. Entries are
made in the purchase journal of the name of the creditor, the amount of
his invoice, and the number of the file where the invoice can be found
in case of need.</p>

<p>Where a separate purchasing department is maintained, the duplicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
purchase orders, corrected if necessary to correspond with the purchase
invoice received, may be used as the basis of the purchase journal. In
this case recapitulation sheets are inserted just as with the sales
journal. The handling of purchases is simplified by the fact that as
a rule they are much smaller in number than sales. The same general
considerations apply to the handling of returned purchases as to
returned sales.</p>

<p><b>Handling Expenses through the Purchase Journal.</b>—It is the
practice of some concerns to treat expenses such as labor, rent,
salaries, supplies, etc., as purchase transactions. Under this method,
instead of postponing the entry until the item is paid, it is made at
the time of securing the service or supplies. The basis for the entry
may be either: (1) the bill or purchase invoice; (2) a formal purchase
memo or voucher made out for each transaction; or (3) the fact that the
expense has been incurred may suffice for the entry on the books with
no formal paper to vouch for it. The use of such formal papers as the
basis for entry is known as the voucher record system. The details of
this system are fully explained in the second volume. Discussion is
here limited to a brief outline of the method and of the advantages of
its use.</p>

<p>When expense invoices are entered and analyzed in the voucher record
form of purchase journal, their posting requires debits to the various
expense accounts and credits to the individual creditors’ accounts
in the ledger. If the ledger contains only a controlling account,
this account must be credited with the total of the expense and other
purchases, while the individual accounts in the creditors subsidiary
ledger must be credited with the details which make up the total. When
the bill is paid, entry in the cash book will not be, as usual, to the
debit of the expense account in the general ledger, but to the debit of
the creditor’s account in the subsidiary ledger. The reason for this
procedure will be made clear in the discussion of controlling accounts
to follow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>The entry of expense invoices in the above manner secures an immediate
record of all liabilities as incurred and therefore makes the books
show at all times the true state of affairs as regards liabilities. The
method, however, necessitates a little more work in making the record,
and for this reason many concerns do not enter expenses until paid,
making the debit to them through the cash book. In this latter case all
unpaid expense bills should be kept in an expense file for reference
when information as to the unrecorded liabilities is desired.</p>

<p><b>Note Journals.</b>—As explained previously, note journals are
sometimes used instead of the general journal for the record of note
transactions, where these are sufficiently numerous. Provision is
sometimes made for securing a proper analysis in order to distinguish
between notes from customers and notes from other sources. It will be
seen later that such an analysis is necessary when controlling accounts
are operated.</p>

<p><b>Analysis in the Cash Book.</b>—The cash journals may be ruled to
furnish any desired analysis, showing on the debit side (i.e., the cash
receipts journal) the sources of receipts, and on the credit side the
objects of expenditure. As the sources of cash receipts are usually
more limited than the objects of expenditures, they do not require so
much analysis. The analysis may be very detailed, the only limit to the
number of columns being the width of the page. A minute analysis of
expenditures, however, is usually made, not in the cash journal, but in
the purchase or voucher record, which thus relieves the cash book of a
mass of detail.</p>

<p>The chief advantage of using additional columns in books of original
entry lies in the fact that time and labor are saved in posting. The
column total is posted in one item, whereas each of the numerous items
composing it would have to be posted separately to the account named
in the column heading if no analytical column were provided. Hence it
would be a waste of space to provide separate columns for items which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
recur so infrequently as to make their summarization unnecessary. Care
should be taken to avoid needless columnization.</p>

<p>It is customary to have the following columns on the debit side of the
cash book: General or Sundry, Accounts Receivable, Sales Discount,
and Net Cash or Bank; on the credit side: General or Sundry, Accounts
Payable, Purchases Discount, and Net Cash or Bank. (<a href="#FORM_38">See page 282
for illustration</a>.) The proof of the distribution is secured by checking the
sum of the net cash and discount columns against the sum of the totals
of the other columns. In both receipts and disbursements journals every
item must appear in the respective Net Cash columns, and from these
distribution is made to the other columns. For example, in the cash
receipts journal, receipts from customers are distributed into the
Accounts Receivable column for the gross amount of each item, and into
Sales Discount for the discount, if any is taken. All other items are
carried into the General or Sundry column. Where several sales ledgers
are kept, additional columns may be provided so that instead of having
one accounts receivable column, there are columns for each ledger.
Similar treatment is given to the disbursements.</p>

<p><b>Analysis in the General Journal.</b>—Where the general journal
is used for returned goods, allowances, and other adjustments with
customers and creditors, use is made of analytic columns with these
captions for both the debit and credit: Accounts Receivable, Accounts
Payable, and General. Here, however, there is no column in which to
enter all items for distribution to the other columns. If a customer’s
or a creditor’s account is affected, entry is made in that column in
the first place. All <i>other</i> entries are in the General column.
(<a href="#FORM_36">See page 281</a> for illustration.)</p>

<p>With regard to analysis columns in the general journal, some
accountants maintain, with good reason, that if the number of
transactions of a particular kind is sufficiently large to justify
their segregation in a separate column, this in itself would be ample
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
justification for the use of a separate journal to record these items.
Whenever the analysis of recurring transactions in the general journal
is facilitated by the use of separate columns, the advisability of
opening a new journal for the record of such items as appear in the
general journal most frequently should be considered.</p>

<p><b>Subdivision of the Ledgers.</b>—The next step in the subdivision
of the records is made in the ledgers. The general or impersonal
accounts of the business are of a more permanent character than the
accounts with persons&mdash;customers and creditors. Consequently, when
once it is determined under what account titles information is desired
and those accounts are set up, there is usually little need to change
their titles. Personal accounts, however, are constantly changing
as some customers are lost and new ones are added, and also because
creditors change with purchases in new markets. Hence, when a business
outgrows its small beginnings, it is customary to keep these changing
accounts in separate books. The basis for the first subdivision of the
ledgers, therefore, is the separation of the accounts into personal
and impersonal. The accounts with customers are carried in a separate
ledger called variously the sales, customers, or accounts receivable
ledger, and those with creditors in a ledger called purchase,
creditors, or accounts payable ledger. All other accounts are kept in
the main ledger known as the general ledger. One advantage of this
subdivision is that several bookkeepers can work on the various ledgers
at the same time.</p>

<p>A further subdivision of the customers ledger is frequently made into
“city” and “country,” the former containing the accounts with customers
located within the city where the business is situated, and the latter
the out-of-the-city accounts. Other subdivisions may be made on an
alphabetical basis, i.e., customers ledger No. 1, containing all
accounts from A to G; customers ledger No. 2, H to M, etc. Sometimes
the concern’s sales territory is divided into arbitrary districts and
the ledgers are subdivided to correspond with such districts.

<b>Kinds of Ledgers.</b>—There are several kinds of ledgers, which may
be classified (1) as to their rulings, and (2) as to their bindings.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Rulings.</span> As to their rulings, ledgers
are either standard, balance, or progressive. The standard ruling has
two duplicate parts, a debit and a credit, and is usually divided in
the center of the page, one money column appearing at the extreme right
of each part, although sometimes the arrangement is symmetrical with
both debit and credit money columns at the center, and the date columns
at either side of the page. (See Forms <a href="#FORM_29">29</a> and
<a href="#FORM_30">30</a>.)</p>

<p>The balance ruling is a three or four-column ledger with the money
columns either at the center or at the right-hand margin, or at both
the center and the right-hand margin. The extra columns are for the
account balances. If the balance is usually either a debit or a credit,
only one balance column would be necessary; where it is apt to be a
debit at one time and a credit at another, a debit balance column
and a credit balance column are advantageous. The balance ruling is
used particularly with personal accounts where there is need for an
up-to-date balance. Where this kind of ledger is used, entry of new
debits or credits should always be on the next blank line as shown in
the balance column, so as to allow the extension of the new balance
opposite the last entry even though this should leave blank several of
the preceding lines on the debit and credit sides. Typical forms of
some of these are shown in Forms 31 and 32.</p>

<p>The Boston, progressive, or tabular ledger, as it is variously called,
makes provision for a <i>horizontal</i> progress of the account as to
sequence of time; the title of the account is written at the left-hand
margin, and one or more lines are allowed to each account according to
the degree of its activity. The account title is written once at the
left margin of the master or main sheet, and is sometimes repeated at
the right margin if the sheet is very wide. The page is divided into
columns for each day of the period. To effect this, short-margin insert
sheets must be bound in to give the desired room for accommodating a
whole period’s record. This style of ruling was formerly much used in
banks where a daily balance for each depositor’s account was necessary.
It is capable of adaptation to other uses, however. One form is shown,
<a href="#FORM_33">Form 33</a>.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
2. <span class="smcap">Bindings.</span> Ledgers may be classified
also as solid-bound, loose-leaf, and card, the titles being
self-explanatory. One of the great advantages of the loose-leaf and
card ledgers over the solid-bound ledger is their flexibility. They
lend themselves easily to any desired grouping of the accounts; they
may be numerically arranged where accounts are numbered instead
of named; they may be arranged as to classes and each class made
self-indexing; or a geographical grouping may be made. Another great
advantage of this form of ledger is the ability to discard or file away
in other binders all “dead” accounts, thus making for ease and facility
in the use of the “live” ledger. Also it is possible for several clerks
to work simultaneously, since the leaves or cards are removable and may
be distributed among any number of clerks. There is always the danger,
however, of failure to return a leaf or card, or of placing it out
of regular order when returning it, or of destroying it, if it were
desired fraudulently to do away with any particular account. The use of
loose-leaf and card ledgers for personal accounts is pretty thoroughly
established, notwithstanding the disadvantages just mentioned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">CONTROLLING ACCOUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Introductory.</b>—Reference to controlling accounts has been made
several times in preceding chapters. It is purposed now to define them
and explain their use. The separation of the various journals on the
basis of an analysis of transactions frees the general journal of a
vast mass of detail it formerly carried. This separation, however, in
no way affects the underlying debit and credit scheme of the whole
system. Each journal is an integral part of the whole; every entry
therein has its equal debit and credit which are in due course posted
to its proper account, thus maintaining the equilibrium of the ledger.
The separation of the ledger into three or more special ledgers in the
interest of economy of effort and ease of use has also been mentioned.
Still, each of these special ledgers is an integral part of the whole
ledger and the accounts in the special ledgers must be entered in the
trial balance to secure proof of equilibrium.</p>

<p>The customers ledger is usually the most active of the various ledgers,
i.e., more postings are made in it because the majority of business
transactions involve dealings of various sorts with customers, and
more accounts are required to keep the records with customers. It
is usually, therefore, the largest part of the whole ledger, but
its accounts are all of the same kind, viz., accounts receivable.
When taking a trial balance, the total of the balances of the
customers ledger accounts is usually set up under the title “Accounts
Receivable,” leaving the details to a supplementary list or schedule.</p>

<p><b>Advantage of a Controlling Account.</b>—The advantage of thus
condensing the trial balance is apparent and suggests the desirability
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
of obtaining the “accounts receivable” balance independently of
the customers ledger. If this is done the bookkeeper in charge of
the general ledger can not only draw up his trial balance without
reference to the customers ledger, but has also the correct figure for
the total of the account balances in the customers ledger. In other
words, he has a figure which controls the customers ledger and which
therefore furnishes him with a check on the accuracy of the ledger
clerk or bookkeeper who keeps that ledger. The most convenient method
of recording the accounts receivable figure is evidently by means of a
formal account on the general ledger. When such an account is kept, the
effect is to make it a summary account whose detail is carried in the
customers ledger.</p>

<p><b>Controlling Account Necessitates Changed Idea of Ledger
Equilibrium.</b>—By having a customers controlling account (or
“Accounts Receivable” as it is commonly called, though other terms are
also used) in the general ledger, the customers ledger is no longer
used as an integral part of the whole ledger and becomes a “subsidiary”
ledger; that is, its function is reduced to that of a supporting
schedule or list of detail for the summary controlling account. The
equilibrium of the general ledger is now maintained by summary posting
to the controlling accounts. Though the customers ledger has ceased
to be a “ledger” in the proper sense of the term, it is still a vital
part of the system, carrying as it does the detail of the summary
controlling account. Moreover, it is linked up to the system by being
provable against its summary account. Yet it should be borne in mind
that its scheme of debit and credit is now an independent one and
is not linked up to the debit and credit equilibrium of the general
ledger; that is, the postings in the subsidiary ledger are merely
memorandum entries of the detail posted in summary form to the general
ledger. Thus the mathematical basis of the controlling account is
simply that the whole is exactly equal to all its parts, the balance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
the summary account being equal to the total of the balances of all
the customers’ accounts of which it is the summary. To illustrate, if
we have customers’ accounts whose balances are $1,000, $2,000, $3,000,
$4,000, and $5,000 respectively, then the summary account must have a
balance of $15,000.</p>

<p><b>Debits to the Controlling Account.</b>—The principle and the
purpose of the controlling account having now been explained, the next
problem to consider is how best to gather the summary figures for its
debits and credits. If every debit to a customer’s account must be
posted also to the controlling account and every credit to a customer’s
account must be shown as a credit in the controlling account the work
involved would be almost doubled and little would be gained by thus
duplicating the postings in another ledger. Therefore it is important
to secure the figures for entry in the controlling accounts with the
least effort, i.e., in the form of debit and credit summaries. Hence,
to determine the sources of these debits and credits of the controlling
account, analysis must be made of the sources of the debits and credits
to the customers’ accounts.</p>

<p>Most of the debits to customers’ accounts are from the sales journal.
Additional debits may be from the cash disbursements journal when cash
payments are made as a rebate or a refund for overpayment or some
other similar transactions; still others from the general journal for
adjustments of various kinds. The debits to customers, however, for
cash paid them are very few in number, because such adjustments usually
are not made by means of cash payments. The sales journal, as usually
operated, carries a column for credit sales, whose total represents in
one amount the total of all detailed debits to customers’ accounts. The
total of the credit sales column, therefore, controls the total debits
to all customers on account of charge sales to them. In summarizing the
sales journal the summary entry should show that this total is to be
posted not only to the credit side of the Sales account but also to the
debit of the controlling account in the ledger. This is so because the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
customers ledger has ceased to be an integral part of the general
ledger, the controlling account having taken its place. Accordingly,
the general ledger contains no record of either the debits or credits
of the entire group of sales transactions until the end of the month,
when this group must therefore be brought into the general ledger in
summary form, both debit and credit.</p>

<p>Where the total sales in the sales journal include an analysis of sales
into cash sales and credit sales, the following summary entry should be
made:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Accounts Receivable</li>
<li class="isub2">Cash</li>
<li class="isub5">Sales</li>
</ul>

<p>The cash debit is set up only to show the equilibrium of the summary
entry and is not posted, because it is entered also in the cash book
and is posted from there. This debit posting to “Accounts Receivable”
in the general ledger secures in one posting a debit amount equal to
all individual debit postings to the customers ledger from this source.
The controlling account in the general ledger is variously termed
“Sales Ledger,” “Accounts Receivable,” “Trade Debtors,” “Customers,”
etc.</p>

<p>The two other sources of debit posting to customers’ accounts are
the general journal and the cash book. The debit side of the journal
is provided with an Accounts Receivable analysis column in which,
as explained in the previous chapter, debits to customers’ accounts
are entered. At posting time the total of this Accounts Receivable
column will therefore give in one figure a debit posting item to the
general ledger Accounts Receivable account equal to all individual
debit postings from the general journal to customers’ accounts in the
customers ledger.</p>

<p>Usually it is not necessary to provide an Accounts Receivable column
on the credit side of the cash book, since debit postings from
there to customers’ accounts are very infrequent. Hence no total or
controlling figure for entry in the Accounts Receivable account can be
obtained. Every item which is posted from this source to the debit of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
customer’s account must be also posted&mdash;item by item&mdash;to the debit
of Accounts Receivable in the general ledger. This is of course a double
debit posting, but one of these debits is to a subsidiary ledger which
is no longer a part of the equilibrium scheme and therefore does not
throw the general ledger out of balance. Great care must be exercised
to make sure that each of these items is posted both to a customer’s
account and also to the Accounts Receivable account.</p>

<p><b>Credits to the Controlling Account.</b>—An analysis of the credits
to customers’ accounts shows four main sources:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The cash receipts journal for payments made by
customers.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. The sales returns journal, if one is kept, for
goods returned by customers.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. The note journal for notes received in
payment.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. The general journal for various adjustments
and also for the purpose of recording notes and returned sales where
special journals are not kept for these transactions.</p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, analytic columns for accounts receivable are provided
in the cash receipts journal and the general journal. The totals of
their columns are posted to the credit of Accounts Receivable, and the
detailed amounts to the credit of the various customers’ accounts. The
credit postings from these sources to the customers ledger accounts
and to the general ledger Accounts Receivable account are therefore
the same so far as totals are concerned. The sales returns journal is
summarized at posting time by means of an entry similar to that in the
sales journal, as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Sales Returns</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">In this case the credit posting to the Accounts
Receivable account is equal to the detailed credits to customers’ accounts.</p>

<p>Similarly, a summary entry for the notes receivable journal secures
a controlling figure for Accounts Receivable. If the notes are all
received from customers to apply on their accounts, the summary entry is:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Notes Receivable</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">the amount being the total of that journal.</p>

<p>In this way the total of all debits and of all credits to the
individual customers’ accounts is represented by the summary items
entered in the general ledger controlling account, Accounts Receivable.
Consequently, the balance of this single account is equal to the
balance of the customers ledger. For the trial balance, therefore, one
account takes the place of hundreds or even thousands of customers’
individual accounts. As a result of this, much time is saved and the
possibility of error on the general ledger is greatly reduced.</p>

<p><b>Proving the Customers Ledger.</b>—The use of a controlling account
in the general ledger, however, does not eliminate the necessity
of proving the accuracy of the customers ledger. It merely makes
it possible to take a trial balance without bringing the numerous
customers’ accounts into it. It is just as much a part of the proof
of the work to make a list of customers’ accounts balances and check
it against the balance of the Accounts Receivable general ledger
account, as it is to prove the general ledger by means of a trial
balance. If there is a discrepancy between the subsidiary ledger and
its controlling account on the general ledger that discrepancy does not
necessarily prevent a trial balance of the general ledger, but it does
show error in the work which must be searched out and corrected.</p>

<p><b>Accounts Payable Account.</b>—A similar arrangement will make
possible a controlling account on the general ledger for the creditors
or purchases ledger. This account is variously termed Accounts Payable,
Purchase Ledger, Creditors, or Trade Creditors account. Its mechanism
is the same as for Accounts Receivable. Analysis of credit postings to
creditors’ accounts shows the purchase journal as their main source.
Other credits come through the general journal and a very few through
the cash receipts journal. The summary entry for the purchase journal is:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Purchases</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Payable</li>
<li class="isub5">Cash</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">This shows a debit to the Purchases account for
the total amount of the purchases, a credit to Accounts Payable for
the liability to creditors, and to Cash for the amount paid on cash
purchases. The cash item is not posted. The Accounts Payable column
total on the credit side of the journal, and the separate items from
the cash receipts journal, furnish the other credits to the Accounts
Payable account in the general ledger.</p>

<p>The debits come from the Accounts Payable columns in the cash
disbursements journal and in the general journal, and the summaries for
the notes payable and purchases returns journals.</p>

<p><b>Basic Principle as to Postings to Controlling Accounts.</b>—In
the handling of controlling accounts, the one fundamental requirement is
to make sure that every entry in books of original entry which affects
any account in the subsidiary ledger is reflected in the postings to
the controlling account in the general ledger. This principle resolves
itself into the mathematical axiom stated above that a whole is equal
to all&mdash;not just some&mdash;of its parts. Only thus can a true
control be established.</p>

<p><b>Making the Subsidiary Ledger Self-Balancing.</b>—Through the use
of the two controlling accounts explained above, the trial balance
is relieved of a large number of accounts, and the general ledger is
made independent of the subsidiary ledgers. On the other hand, the
subsidiary ledgers are dependent for their proof on the controlling
account balances in the general ledger. In an effort to make every
ledger “self-balancing,” a further refinement of the controlling
account idea is frequently incorporated in each subsidiary ledger. It
is accomplished in the following manner: An exact duplicate of the
controlling account on the general ledger is set up in the subsidiary
ledger, <i>with this difference</i>, that the sides of the account are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
reversed so that the subsidiary ledger account has for its debits the
credits of the general ledger account, and for its credits the debits
of the general ledger account.</p>

<p>Take the Accounts Receivable controlling account for illustration.
On the general ledger its balance is of course a debit balance
representing the total outstanding accounts due from customers.
Similarly, the schedule or list of customers’ accounts taken from the
sales ledger will represent debit balances whose total is the same as
the controlling account balance. If, then, the controlling account
itself is placed on the customers ledger as an additional account,
the sides being reversed, the balance of this one account will be a
credit equal to the total debit balance of all the other accounts in
the customers ledger. Therefore, if the customers ledger is correct,
its own balance will be offset exactly by the credit balance of the one
additional account, and the ledger then is said to be self-balancing.
There is no theory or principle of debit and credit involved in this;
the device is simply introduced in order that the ledger may provide
an internal proof of its correctness. The title of the balancing
account on the subsidiary ledger is “Adjustment” or “Balance” and has
no significance other than that mentioned. In a similar manner any
subsidiary ledger may be made self-balancing.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">HANDLING CONTROLLING ACCOUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#Page_264">Chapter XXX</a> concerned itself with the statement
and explanation of the principles on which the controlling account rests,
the manner of its construction, its advantages, and with the changed
application of the fundamental scheme of debit and credit under a
system of records operating controlling accounts. The present chapter
will be devoted to a consideration of the problems met with in the
practical operation of these accounts.</p>

<p><b>Introduction of the Controlling Account.</b>—Upon the
installation of a new system or set of books, the controlling account
feature may be incorporated from the start. The new system must provide
for the separation from the general ledger, of the ledgers over which
control is to be established. The method of securing controlling totals
for posting to the general ledger controlling accounts was indicated in
the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>Where it is desired to introduce controlling accounts into a system
which has not formerly used them, certain adjustments must be made,
i.e., the accounts to be controlled must be segregated and controlling
account columns must be provided for in the books of original entry.
With the transfer of these accounts to a separate ledger, together with
the introduction of the controlling accounts into the general ledger,
the equilibrium of that ledger is maintained. The opening entry in
the newly established controlling account is of course the sum of the
balances of the transferred accounts.</p>

<p>If it is desired to establish the new controlling account by journal entry,
that entry would appear somewhat as shown on page 279, <a href="#FORM_34">Form 34</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
with suitable explanation added. All these items should be posted to
the general ledger as shown by the entry, and in addition the detailed
items should be posted as debits to the accounts in the customers
ledger. The effect of these postings would be, first, to close the
individual customers’ accounts formerly carried in the general ledger
and open up in their stead the controlling account; and second, to set
up on the subsidiary ledger the detail of the customers’ accounts.</p>

<p><b>Recording Withdrawals of Stock-in-Trade.</b>—The original basis for
separating the main journal into its subsidiary parts was the analysis
of transactions by kinds, such as sales, purchases, cash, etc. The
sales journal was presumed to contain only sales of stock-in-trade.
Departure from this principle was advisable in the case of goods
drawn at cost, for use in the business or by the proprietor or for
other purposes. This is done because withdrawals of stock-in-trade,
at whatever price and for whatever purpose, can be recorded more
conveniently in the sales journal than elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is theoretically incorrect, however, to enter such items in the
Sales account because withdrawals at cost do not represent actual
sales, and for this reason they should be regarded as deductions from
purchases or from inventory. The only proper place for their record,
under this view, is the general journal, entry in which would have
to be by detailed debit and credit for each item. However, because
this requires much more work than entry in the sales journal, this
last method is more commonly employed. Usually the volume of such
transactions is not large and would not seriously vitiate the use of
the Sales account as the basis for estimating percentages of cost of
goods sold, gross profit, selling expenses, etc. Moreover, as the total
amount of these withdrawals is often fairly constant as between periods
their record in the sales journal is countenanced.</p>

<p><b>The Problem of the Sales Journal Summary.</b>—When withdrawals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
from stock at cost price are recorded in the sales journal, a new problem
arises in summarizing the sales journal when operating under a
controlling account system. The customers or sales ledger is usually
limited absolutely to customers’ accounts. Accounts with the
proprietors, and with all other titles under which withdrawals for
other purposes may be recorded, are almost invariably carried in the
general ledger. Therefore, while most of the items entered in the sales
journal are posted to the customers ledger, these withdrawal items must
be posted in detail to the general ledger. Thus the total of the sales
journal does not represent the correct debit to accounts receivable in
the general ledger. Evidently an analysis of the content of the sales
journal must be made in order to obtain the correct controlling figure.</p>

<p>Such analysis may be made in several ways. Where possible, three
columns in addition to the departmental columns should be used. The
column titles would be “Sales Ledger,” “Cash,” and “Sundry.” The sum
of these three would give the total to check against the total of the
other distributive columns, but only the “Sales Ledger” total would be
posted to Accounts Receivable, and the individual items in that column
would be posted to the customers’ accounts in the sales ledger. The
items in Sundry column would be posted to their named accounts in the
general ledger. This method secures an automatic separation of the
controlling account total from other items, and should be used where
possible.</p>

<p>If the number of these extraneous items is too small to warrant the
use of a separate column, they may be recorded in the Sales Ledger
column and indicated by means of an “❌” or some other mark. At summary
time, the sales journal must be looked over and these items picked out.
Subtraction of their sum from the Sales Ledger column total would give
the correct controlling account posting.</p>

<p>Still another method requires a correcting general journal entry at the
time the sales journal entry is made. Under this method these special
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
items are included in the Sales Ledger column, thereby causing an
overcharge to Accounts Receivable. The correcting general journal
entry must therefore credit Accounts Receivable by the amount of the
overcharge for each item. For instance, if stock has been drawn by the
proprietor, the general journal entry at the time the sales journal
entry is made would be:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Proprietor, Personal</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">the debit to proprietor being checked here and
posted from the sales journal, or vice versa. This method, however,
results in a duplication of work. It would be preferable not to enter
these items in the sales journal and to make the record only in the
general journal, and so leave the Sales Ledger column total in the
sales journal the correct controlling figure.</p>

<p>In a complicated controlling account system, where for current entry
a simple bookkeeping routine must be established and all items
of whatever kind be handled in the same way, the withdrawals by
proprietors are recorded in accounts opened with them in the sales
ledger just as with customers. At the end of the period, before closing
the books, these proprietors’ accounts are transferred by general
journal entry to the general ledger, requiring one entry&mdash;like the
one last shown above&mdash;for the drawings of the period.</p>

<p>Cash sales may also be handled without the use of a separate column in
the sales journal. Two methods are used for this. Under the one, cash
sales are included in the Accounts Receivable debit total of the sales
journal, although the individual items are not posted to the subsidiary
ledger, and they are also included in the Accounts Receivable credit
total of the cash receipts journal. The inflated debit in the general
ledger controlling account is thus offset by an equally inflated
credit, the balance therefore being the correct amount to control the
sales ledger.</p>

<p>Under the other method the postings to the general ledger controlling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
account are the same as in the first method. The two methods differ,
however, in that under the second method an account is opened in the
subsidiary ledger entitled “Cash Customers” or “Cash Sales,” to the
debit of which are posted in detail the cash sales items from the sales
journal and to the credit of which are posted in detail the cash sales
items from the cash receipts journal. The account is thus only a “wash”
or clearing account. This method, however, prevents the inflated debits
and credits in the controlling account.</p>

<p>The methods last described for handling proprietors’ withdrawals and
cash sales are the ones most frequently used in large businesses where
simplicity of routine for current entry must be secured.</p>

<p><b>The Problem of the Purchase Journal Summary.</b>—The practice
of recording extraneous transactions in the purchase journal brings about
at summary time a situation similar to that of the sales journal, when
a controlling Accounts Payable account is maintained. The purchase
journal is, and should be, the place of record for purchases made for
the business. If the proprietor (or other person), for his personal
account and use, purchases through the business merchandise which never
goes into stock, accurate accounting requires such transactions to be
charged direct to the proprietor and not to the Purchases account of
the business. Inasmuch as the liability is assumed by the business
and the creditor’s account will appear in the purchase ledger, the
use of the purchase journal total for credit to the Accounts Payable
controlling account gives the correct figure. The trouble comes in
because this same figure cannot be used as the debit to Purchases.
Subtraction of these extraneous items must be made to determine the
proper amount chargeable to the Purchases account, thus necessitating
an analysis at summary time.</p>

<p><b>Accounts Both Receivable and Payable.</b>—It frequently happens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
that purchases from, and sales to, the same party are made, i.e., goods
are sometimes bought from and sold to a customer. If the account of
this debtor-creditor is normally a purchase account, it is set up in
the purchase ledger. If a sale is made to this debtor-creditor and
charged to his purchase ledger account, such transaction should not be
included in the Accounts Receivable controlling figure from the sales
journal unless an adjusting entry is made through the general journal.
Such entry would affect only the controlling accounts and would be:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Accounts Payable</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">Or the item might be omitted from the sales
journal controlling figure and stated separately in the summary entry
for the sales journal.</p>

<p>A more satisfactory method is to set up two accounts with such
parties&mdash;one as a creditor, the other as a customer. Then no adjustment
need be made at the time of summarizing the journals, because the
two accounts are treated as entirely independent of each other. The
settlement of these two accounts may be handled separately or by a
payment of the balance between the two. If settled by balance, an
adjusting journal entry should be made to show on the books the two
separate elements involved. This would of course affect both the
controlling accounts and the two individual accounts.</p>

<p><b>The Problem of the Note Journals Summaries.</b>—Of notes
receivable the large majority are usually received from customers.
The summary entry for such is:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Notes Receivable</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">Where notes are received from other sources, as
from officers, partners, or from outside parties to whom loans have
been made, it is evident that these must not be included in the credit
to Accounts Receivable, and it may be advisable also to eliminate them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
from Notes Receivable unless they are short-term, current items, as
only such should be carried under Notes Receivable. These special notes
may be carried in a “Notes Receivable Special” account.</p>

<p>If, as sometimes happens, interest is included in the face of a note,
this must be adjusted by the summary entry, as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Notes Receivable</li>
<li class="isub5">Accounts Receivable</li>
<li class="isub5">Interest Income</li>
</ul>

<p>The considerations stated above as applicable to the notes receivable
journal, are of equal importance in handling the notes payable journal.
A very careful analysis of the note journals should be made at a
summary time, which analysis should be shown by the summary entry.</p>

<p><b>Summary Entries for Columnar Books.</b>—Illustration will now
be given of some standard forms for summarizing the columnar journals.
Sometimes the summary entries for the various subsidiary journals are
made in the general journal. This seems to accomplish no good purpose
and is not usually recommended. Theoretically it is desirable to show a
formal debit and credit summary for each journal footing posted to the
ledger. If, however, the number of columns is small and it is readily
seen that the debits and credits are equal, the formal summary is often
dispensed with. So also, if there are many distributive columns of
the same effect, i.e., debit or credit, as in the large departmental
sales journal or the voucher register referred to on <a href="#Page_144">page 144</a>,
formal summary is not shown, the posting being made from the column totals as
<a href="#FORM_39">illustrated for Petty Cash on page 369</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Sales Journal Summary.</b>—An illustration of the sales
journal summary is given in <a href="#FORM_35">Form 35</a>. The Sundry
items should be posted in detail from their column and their total
checked in the summary entry. Where a Sundry column is not used and
the Sundry items are included in the Sales Ledger column, they must be
separated before the summary entry can be made.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_34" src="images/i_279a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="163" />

  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 35. Sales Journal Summary</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
Where, also, a Cash column is not carried, as is so often the case,
there being just one column for Sales Ledger, Cash, and Sundry items,
from which distribution is made, the separation of the Cash items need
not be shown in the summary entry, provided those items are entered
also in the Sales Ledger column of the cash book. Where, due to the
large number of distributive columns, the sales journal can ill afford
the room for a Cash column, the above method offers the best solution
of the problem.</p>

<p>The purchase journal summary is similar to that of the sales journal,
and therefore no separate illustration need be given here.</p>

<p><b>The General Journal Summary.</b>—As shown by the illustration
in <a href="#FORM_36">Form 36</a>, in summarizing the general journal
the Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable columns are formally
totaled, ruled off, and their totals brought into the General columns
on both debit and credit sides and these columns are totaled and ruled
off, thus showing the equilibrium of the journal. This summary entry
is posted to the proper accounts in the general ledger. There is no
particular advantage, however, in this formal summary entry because the
postings could easily be made directly from the column totals.</p>

<p><b>The Cash Book Summaries.</b>—As illustrated in Forms 37 and 38,
the formal summary for each side of the cash book shows the equality of
the Bank and Discount columns total against the General and Accounts
Receivable and Payable columns. To show the correct debit to the bank
for the present month, the balance brought forward from last month and
entered in both the General and Bank columns on December 1, must now be
subtracted from both.</p>

<p>On the disbursements side no explanation of the summary entry is
necessary. It will be noted that, to show the balance of the bank
account, a restatement of the Bank column total is necessary.

<b>Other Controlling Accounts.</b>—It is frequently desirable to keep
some accounts of the business private, such as those showing partners’
investments, drawings, ratios of sharing profits, the adjusting and
closing entries, the profit and loss, etc. This can be accomplished
through the use of a private ledger supported by a private journal
and sometimes a private cash book. For their operation a controlling
account of the private ledger is set up in the general ledger, and
similarly a controlling account of the general ledger appears in the
private ledger. The use of private books is explained in Volume II of
this work.</p>

<p>Sometimes subsidiary expense ledgers are used to carry a minute
division of each expense group, with corresponding controlling
accounts, such as Selling Expense, Office Expense, General Expense,
Factory Expense. Similarly, if the consignment sales of a business are
large enough to justify a separate record in a consignments ledger, a
controlling account is set up in the general ledger. In a manufacturing
business, Raw Materials, Goods in Process, and Finished Goods accounts
are often controlling accounts for the stores, jobs, and finished stock
ledgers. In a corporation the Capital Stock account (or accounts) is a
controlling account over the stock ledger.</p>

<p><b>Principle Governing Content of Subsidiary Ledgers.</b>—Before
closing this chapter, it should be stated as a fundamental principle
that no accounts should be carried in a subsidiary ledger except such
as are of the same general kind and can without misrepresentation be
carried under the group title of the controlling account.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PARTNERSHIP FROM THE<br />
BUSINESS VIEWPOINT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Partnership Defined.</b>—In <a href="#Page_11">Chapter II</a>,
reference was made to some of the features of a partnership&mdash;the
purpose of its formation, advantages, disadvantages, etc. The laws of
the state of New York define a partnership as follows: “A partnership,
as between the members thereof, is the association, not incorporated,
of two or more persons who have agreed to combine their labor, property
and skill or some of them for the purpose of engaging in any lawful trade
or business, and sharing the profits and losses as such between them.”</p>

<p>This definition brings out in a general way the reasons for the
formation of the partnership and its essential features. Under this
type of organization, where several persons combine their capitals,
it is possible to secure a larger fund of capital than under the sole
proprietorship. This opens to the partnership avenues of business
usually closed to the sole proprietor. The bringing together of the
man with a special aptitude or skill, or of a man with a following in
the community on account of social standing and acquaintanceship, with
another who has money or a plant for the operation of a business, often
makes successful an otherwise unpromising undertaking.</p>

<p><b>Operating Feature and Working Organization.</b>—Mutual agency
is the essential operating feature of the partnership. By this is meant
that any one of the partners can act for the others, and in the eyes
of the law all are equally responsible for the management of the
business. Except in the case of a limited partnership, to be explained
later, each partner has an equal voice in the management and control of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
affairs. Unlike the corporation where for management purposes the
owners’ powers are delegated to a controlling board, the essential
character of the partnership is that each partner has, regardless of
the amount of his investment, an equal right in the direction of its
business. As between themselves, for purposes of division of duties
and specialization of effort, definite power to exercise control
over certain features of the business may be delegated to individual
partners. But such delegation means nothing more than a method of
dividing the work and is simply the working organization of the firm
which may be changed at any time the majority of the partners see fit.
Thus, while a partner may be limited in his actions for the firm by
agreement among the partners, so that he is not a general agent for
the firm, still as to outsiders who know nothing of this internal
arrangement, he has power to bind the partnership by his acts, because
an outsider has a right to expect that any partner has power to act as
an agent for the firm. This is so because such power is of the essence
of the partnership form.</p>

<p><b>Essential Characteristics of the Partnership.</b>—Limited life
is an essential characteristic of the partnership. The partnership
relation is a very personal one. It can be terminated in a number of
ways, but the death or retirement of any member automatically works
a dissolution of the firm, even though another man takes his place.
The legal theory is that the old partnership is dead and a new one,
even though bearing the same firm name, has come into existence.
Thus a partnership cannot be perpetual. The relationship between the
partners is so intimate that the success of the undertaking depends
fundamentally on the good faith and honor exercised by each partner
towards the others, and therefore any addition to the personnel of a
partnership can be made only with the consent of all members of the
existing firm.</p>

<p>The partnership being the outgrowth of the sole proprietorship, certain
of the aspects of its earlier form still cling to it. For suit at law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
it is looked upon as a collection of single owners, and action on
contract must usually be taken against the individual members of the
firm. Suit by or against the partnership cannot as a rule be brought
in the firm name. Some states, however, allow this under recent
enactments. Title to personalty can be held and transferred under the
firm name, but realty must be in the name of the individual members or
in the name of one member acting as trustee for the firm. Thus, while
in the view of the business community the copartnership is a business
entity under a firm name, in the sight of the law it is not an entity
but merely a collection of single owners. This legal view accounts
also for the full debt liability of every partner&mdash;except in a limited
partnership. In case the firm assets are insufficient to meet the
claims of creditors, any or all the partners’ private resources may be
levied upon.</p>

<p>Co-ownership of the profits of a business is another feature essential
to the copartnership. No sharing in the profits on any other basis than
that of co-ownership will constitute a partnership. When the question
comes before the courts, the intention of the parties governs, and
evidence showing that each acted as principal for himself and as agent
for the others, and has shared profits as profits, would be sufficient
to constitute the relationship.</p>

<p><b>The Partnership Contract.</b>—A partnership being a contract
relationship, all the requirements governing legality of contracts,
such as agreement, consideration, lawful object, competency of
contracting parties, etc., apply to the copartnership. The contract
may be oral or in writing. In case of dispute an oral contract, on
account of the difficulty of proof, is of little force in regulating
the relations of the partners, and the general law of partnership
would usually govern. Inasmuch as there is so great an opportunity for
disputes in a relationship of this sort, it is imperative, if efficient
working relations are to be maintained, that very carefully drawn
articles of copartnership be agreed upon before active business is
begun. These articles should contain, at least, the following:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The name of the firm and of the partners.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">2. The kind and place of business.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">3. The duration of the partnership.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">4. The method of terminating it.</p>
<p class="neg-indent">5. A detailed statement of the relations between
the partners, such as duties and powers, capital contributions,
withdrawals of capital, salaries, division of profits and losses,
interest on capital, and the time of closing the books to secure a
definite determination of the partners’ interests.</p>
</div>

<p>Even when the utmost care is exercised in drafting the articles
of partnership, it almost always happens that some portion is not
understood alike by all or that some contingency arises not
specifically provided for. Nevertheless, it is the only way in
which a comparative avoidance of misunderstanding and dispute
can be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Partnerships Classified.</b>—As to the scope of their business
operations, partnerships are usually classified into general and
special. The general class embraces those for the conduct of some
general or ordinary lines of business. The special class comprises
those formed to undertake a definite task or some particular line of
business. Joint ventures would come under this latter class.</p>

<p>As to the liability of their members, partnerships may be classified
as general and limited. The general partner has the full liability,
referred to above; the limited partner’s liability never exceeds the
amount of his investment. In a limited partnership one or more, but not
all, members may limit their liability. This class of partnership can
be formed only under direct authority of statute law. A limited partner
is not active in the management of the business, being more in the
nature of a lender of money to the firm, who gets his return in profits
instead of interest. Should he become active in the firm’s management,
he will constitute himself an ordinary partner with full liability. The
New York statute governing the formation of the limited partnership is
as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Two or more persons may form a limited partnership which shall
consist of one or more persons of full age, called <i>general</i>
partners, and also of one or more persons of full age who contribute
in actual cash payments, a special sum as capital, to the common
stock&mdash;or fund&mdash;called <i>special</i> partners, for the
transaction within this state of any lawful business, except banking
and insurance by making, severally signing and acknowledging and
causing to be filed and recorded in the clerk’s office in the county
where the principal place of business of such partnership is located, a
certificate in which is stated:</p>

<p class="neg-indent">1. The name or firm under which such partnership
is to be conducted and the county wherein the principal place of
business is to be located.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. The general nature of the business intended to
be transacted.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. The names, and whether of full age, of all
general and special partners therein, distinguishing which are general
and which are special partners, and their places of residence.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. The amount of capital which each special partner
has contributed to the common stock&mdash;or fund.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. The time at which the partnership is to begin
and end.</p>
</div>

<p>Affidavit of the payment of capital must be made and a notice of
the formation of the partnership published in a paper of general
circulation. The limited partnership is thus hedged about with
safeguards for creditors, bankers, and other interested parties,
particularly by the rule that a limited partnership cannot exist unless
there are one or more general partners with full liability.</p>

<p><b>The Joint-Stock Company.</b>—The joint-stock company is a
partnership or association in which ownership, voice in the management,
and profit-sharing ratio are evidenced by transferable shares of stock.
Control and management are exercised through a board of directors
chosen by the stockholders. If the company becomes bankrupt and the
firm assets are insufficient to satisfy creditors, the members are
personally liable to the full extent of their private property in the
same way as in a general partnership.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>The mining partnership is a form of joint-stock company which operates
in mining communities. Usually the mining property itself is beyond the
scope of such a partnership, only the development of this property by
means of a lease being contemplated. Unlike the ordinary partnership,
the members of a mining partnership may assign their shares of
ownership. Upon their death or bankruptcy, their interests pass to
others who take their place in the partnership without the consent of
the remaining partners. Thus, the confidential relationship based on
the right of selection of its members, characteristic of the ordinary
partnership, is largely lacking in the mining partnership.</p>

<p><b>Partners Classified.</b>—Finally, brief mention may be made
of the following terms applied to partners to indicate varying degrees
of activity within the ordinary partnership:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Ostensible partners&mdash;those who hold
themselves out and are known to be partners.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Nominal&mdash;those who are known as partners
but who have no real interest in the firm.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Dormant or silent&mdash;those who are not
known to outsiders as partners and who take no active part in the
management of the firm’s affairs.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. Secret partners&mdash;those who are not known
as partners to outsiders but who have an interest and take active part
in managing the firm.</p>
</div>

<p>For more detailed information as to a partner’s rights, duties, and
responsibilities to his copartners and to outsiders, a standard legal
text on partnerships or business law should be consulted. The student
should also read <a href="#Page_11">Chapter II</a> in connection with
this chapter and the next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PARTNERSHIP FROM THE<br />
ACCOUNTING VIEWPOINT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>From the fact that the law looks upon the partnership as a combination
or collection of sole owners, some of the accounting problems arising
out of the partnership form of organization are unique, and a partial
or full treatment of some of these problems will be given in this chapter.</p>

<p><b>Profit-Sharing in the Partnership.</b>—Of these problems perhaps
the one occurring most frequently is that concerning the division of
profits. Attention was called in <a href="#Page_284">Chapter XXXII</a>
to the need of explicit statement on this point in the articles of
copartnership under the head of the intrapartnership relations. Since
men combine their capitals for the purpose of realizing profits, it
would naturally be supposed that all partnership agreements would
be specific on that point. Yet it very often happens that many
contingencies relating to the matter of profit-sharing have not been
foreseen and as a result disputes arise.</p>

<p>The fundamental principles governing profit distribution may be stated
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Where the agreement is silent, the law provides that profits shall
be divided equally among the partners regardless of the amounts of
their respective investments of capital. Some partners may have made no
investments of money or property, setting up their particular skill and
aptitude or standing in the community as their share and contribution
to the profit-earning capacity of the organization. Unless it is
specifically agreed otherwise, these will share equally in any profits.</p>

<p>2. Where profits are to be shared in the same ratio as capital, the
agreement should specify whether the basis of division is to be the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
original investments or the capitals as shown at the beginning of
each period, which would be the original investments plus profits
left in the business. This latter interpretation would usually result
in a changing ratio for succeeding periods, whereas under the former
interpretation the ratio of profit-sharing would be always the same.</p>

<p>3. Provision should be made, either in the original articles or at a
subsequent time, for a change in the profit-sharing ratio in the event
of a partner’s withdrawing some portion of his original investment if
such withdrawal is allowed. It may be stated here that an agreement
between the partners as to any ratio for division of profits can
be made at any time and will govern such ratio, but must be on a
determinable basis.</p>

<p>4. Where the articles are silent as to the division of losses, the
profit-sharing ratio governs. Where a different ratio is desired,
specific statement of it must be made. Of course, upon the inception
of an undertaking losses are not contemplated, but the experience of
others should cause provision to be made for apportionment of losses in
order to avoid possible difficulties or disputes.</p>

<p>5. Unless the articles&mdash;or subsequent agreements&mdash;provide for the
payment of salaries to any or all of the partners, none are allowed.</p>

<p>6. The conditions governing the partners’ drawings should be explicit
as to the amount to be drawn during a given period. It should be stated
explicitly whether excess drawings shall be regarded as a charge
against capital, or as the basis for an interest charge, or simply as
an excess drawing standing in the partner’s current account without
penalty other than a disallowance of future drawings until lapse of
time brings the total amount drawn within the agreed limitations.</p>

<p>7. The manner of handling undrawn profits should be made definite. Are
they to be transferred to the capital account and so be made a part
of capital, resulting in changing capital ratios; or are they to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
carried as open balances in the drawing accounts and thus take on the
nature of temporary loans subject to withdrawal at any time?</p>

<p><b>Average Investment as a Basis for Profit-Sharing.</b>—Attention
should be called to a basis for profit-sharing sometimes employed
for special partnerships, entered into for the performance of a
specific contract or for doing any special work. In these cases the
capital needed may not be known at the start, or if known may not
all be required then but is to be furnished by whichever partner may
have available funds at the time of need. In such cases the basis of
profit-sharing may be made the amount of capital furnished by each
partner and the length of time of its use in the enterprise. Two
methods of determining the ratio may be employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Method.</span> Each investment may be
multiplied by the number of days occurring between the date on which
the investment was made and the date of profit determination, giving
a result which may be called “day-dollars” of investment in a sense
similar to the term foot-pound in physics. From the total day-dollars
of investment must be subtracted the day-dollars of withdrawals,
arrived at similarly, thus showing net investment in terms of
day-dollars. The sum of all the investments in day-dollars becomes
the basis on which to prorate profits, each partner’s share being
the part which his individual net investments bear to this total net
investment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Method.</span> The original investment
of each partner may be multiplied by the time it remains unchanged,
i.e., until it is added to or some portion is withdrawn. Similarly,
this changed capital is multiplied by the time it remains fixed, and so
for every change. The total of these items constitutes each partner’s
net investment, from which the profit-sharing ratio is determinable as
above. In the problem given below, for purposes of illustration the
dates are so taken that the calculation can be made on a month-dollar
instead of a day-dollar basis, thus shortening the operation. The capital
accounts of the partners, showing investments and withdrawals, are as follows:

The first method will, of course, give identical results. The second
method has the slight advantage that the Investment Months column will
always total the same as the length of the fiscal period, provided each
partner makes his initial investment at the first of the period—which
is not always the case—and acts as a check on the accuracy of that
part of the calculation.</p>

<p><b>Interest on Partners’ Investments.</b>—A second problem of
importance in connection with partnership accounting is the interest
on partners’ investments. The purpose of allowing such interest is
twofold: First, it may serve as an indication of the excess of the
profits in this enterprise over the return on the investment of a like
amount in the money market, thus dividing the partnership profits into
two parts, interest and management earnings; and second, it may serve
as a method of distributing profits up to a certain amount on the basis
of capital investments, where the agreed-on ratio is different from the
capital ratio, thus distributing the period’s profits on two different
bases or ratios.</p>

<p>This is done sometimes to equalize somewhat the comparatively
smaller-ratio profits of the partners who have made the larger
investments. This problem, however, will be treated more fully in a
later chapter where the methods of booking the interest, its treatment
in case of a loss instead of a profit, and the computation of
interest on drawings as well as on investments will be discussed and
illustrated. Suffice it to say here that disputes frequently occur in
connection with these problems and that detailed provision as to their
handling should be made in the partnership agreement.</p>

<p><b>Valuation and Correct Booking of Original Investments.</b>—A
third matter of importance is the valuation and correct booking of
the original investments other than cash. In the case of the sole
proprietor this is of comparatively little importance because he will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
always reap the entire gain and therefore suffer no harm ultimately
from present undervaluation of his property investments. In the
partnership, however, where separate investment and personal accounts
must be kept with each member, the correct valuation of the assets is
of importance, inasmuch as the property of the partnership is the joint
property of all partners and all will share ultimately in the effect of
any under-or over-valuation at the time of investment. The partners’
accounts are set up for the purpose of showing their respective
interests in the enterprise, and after investments are once brought
onto the books these accounts govern the equities of the various partners.</p>

<p><b>Distinction between Buying Out an Interest and Making an Investment
to Secure an Interest.</b>—The taking in of a partner by a sole
proprietor or his admission as a new member to an existing partnership
raises a point about which there must be a very definite understanding.
A distinction must be made between purchasing from the owners an
interest in the business as it stands at any given time and making
an investment in a business to secure such an interest. The first
transaction is of a personal nature between the owners and a third
party who is a purchaser; in the other transaction the third party, who
is an investor, puts in money to acquire an interest and his investment
becomes the common property of all the owners of whom he is now one. In
the one case the capital of the business is not increased, in the other
case it is increased by the amount of the new investment. For example,
if a balance sheet shows:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110 space-above1" border="0" cellspacing="0"

   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>

<p class="no-indent">and Jackson sells a half-interest to B. Killian
for a given consideration, the new balance sheet becomes:</p>

<p>The question of good-will which frequently comes up when an interest in
a going business is secured will be treated in <a href="#Page_305">Chapter XXXV</a>,
where also the manner of closing the books of the old business and opening
those of the new firm will be shown.</p>

<p><b>Final Considerations.</b>—From the foregoing discussion it is
evident that the partnership relation gives rise to some of the most
vexing questions which confront the accountant and the lawyer. It is a
truism, therefore, that in drawing up the partnership agreement, all
eventualities should be foreseen as nearly as possible and that they
should be carefully provided for. As a final safeguard it is well to
provide for the submission to arbitrators of disputes subsequently
arising, the decision to be binding upon all the partners. This will
avoid endless, expensive, and usually unsatisfactory actions at law
and will more nearly secure justice to all. As a step in the same
direction, it is suggested that provision be made for the drawing up of
correct balance sheets and profit and loss statements, that sufficient
time be allowed each partner to examine them as to their correctness
and, if satisfied, that each be compelled to subscribe to them. This
will localize any dissatisfaction within a limited time period and
secure its adjustment while all salient points are still fresh in the
minds of the interested parties.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">CAPITALIZATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Sources of Capital.</b>—From an accounting viewpoint, the capital
of any business enterprise is the excess of its assets over its
liabilities. Usually, the main fund of capital is secured by original
contribution. In a partnership, the partners’ investments provide the
common partnership fund. Thereafter, additions to the capital may be
secured in several ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Profits may be left in the business instead of
being withdrawn.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Specific contributions may be made by the
partners, which are either to be considered as additions to their
capital investment, or are to be treated as more or less temporary
loans to the business.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. A new partner may be taken in, his
contribution increasing the partnership capital.</p>
</div>

<p>The present chapter deals with original investments and with the
first two types of additional capital mentioned above, while the next
chapter discusses the admission of new members and the consolidation of
partnerships.</p>

<p><b>Original Contributions.</b>—It sometimes happens that the
partnership agreement does not state specifically how much each partner
shall invest in the business. For example, the agreement may state that
partner A is to contribute certain properties, i.e., place of business
and equipment; that B is to contribute a stock of goods, and that the
investments of the remaining partners are to consist of cash, the exact
amount of which is not stated because it depends upon the valuation to
be placed upon the property and merchandise invested by A and B.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>After such a valuation has been made and the amounts of the cash
contributions have been determined, it may be found that the total
investment is more than the business requires; or it may develop that
some of the partners do not have sufficient funds available to pay
their shares, while others may be able to contribute more than their
respective shares. It thus happens that the partnership agreement is
not always rigidly enforced, some partners contributing more, and
others less, than the agreed amounts. At the time this is looked
upon as a temporary arrangement, but it often results in a permanent
condition. The partnership agreement should contain provision for such
a contingency. If it does not, a later agreement should be made to
regulate the relations between the partners.</p>

<p><b>Adjustment of Capital Contributions.</b>—Whenever a partner
contributes more than his agreed share, it is customary to allow him
interest on the excess amount, and other partners whose investment may
be less than the agreed amount are usually charged with interest. This
is obviously an equitable method of meeting the situation.</p>

<p>As a rule, these interest adjustments are handled through the Profit
and Loss account, i.e., the partners who invest less than the agreed
share are considered to owe interest to the partnership, and those who
invest more have an interest claim against the business—not against
the other partners individually. The debit or credit balance in the
Profit and Loss account resulting from these adjustments is in turn
distributed among <i>all</i> the partners in the profit-or-loss-sharing
ratios. It should be clearly understood, however, that although these
adjustments are made through the Profit and Loss account, there is no
element of business profit or expense involved. For this reason, these
interest entries should be made direct in the appropriation section of
the Profit and Loss, and should never be booked in the regular Interest
accounts.</p>

<p>The following illustrations will bring out the different methods of
adjustment:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap"><b>Problem.</b></span> A, B, and C are equal
partners under an agreement to contribute each $15,000. Provision is
made that excess contributions are to be credited with interest at
6% and that deficits are to be charged at the same rate. The records
show that actual contributions were: A, $18,000; B, $13,000; and C,
$11,000.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Three methods of adjustment will be shown.</p>

<p class="fontsize_110"><b><span class="smcap">First Method</span></b></p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">These three interest amounts are brought upon
the books by the following journal entries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The net effect of these adjustments is a credit to A of $240, and
debits to B and C of $60 and $180 respectively.</p>

<p>Note that A is credited with $180 for his excess of $3,000, and
Profit and Loss is debited with the same amount, because it is the
business that owes him this interest. If this Profit and Loss debit
is distributed separately, A’s share of it is $60, so that his real
credit on his $3,000 excess is not $180 but $120. On the other hand,
the combined debits to B and C result in a credit to Profit and Loss of
$360, and if this item is distributed as such, A’s share of it is $120,
thus making his total credit on the complete adjustment $240. A similar
explanation applies to the adjustments for B and C.</p>

smallest investment, viz., $11,000 by C. This would show A’s excess
over C as $7,000, and B’s excess over C as $2,000, and these two
amounts may be treated as loans to the business. The result is that A
is credited with 6% on $7,000, and B with 6% on $2,000, as follows:</p>

to C. Instead of making the adjustment through the Profit and Loss
account as in the first two methods, the interest is now adjusted
between the three partners as private persons, the entries affecting
only the partners’ personal accounts. This adjustment results in a
credit to A and a debit to B for $60, A having loaned B $1,000; and in
a credit to A and a debit to C for $180, A having loaned C $3,000. A’s
total credit is $240, and B’s and C’s debits are respectively $60 and
$180, the same as by the other two methods.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that any of the three methods employed leads to the
same results. It will be observed, however, that in the example given
the contemplated investments are to be equal for the three partners
($15,000), and the profit and loss is to be shared on the same basis.
The three different methods of adjusting interest lead to the same
result only when the profit-sharing ratio is identical with the ratio
between the contemplated investments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p><b>Averaging Investments.</b>—In temporary partnerships, organized
for carrying out a particular undertaking, the amount of capital
needed is often not known and may vary at different stages of the
undertaking. Here the partners usually contribute as need arises, and
withdraw when funds not needed in the business become free. Under such
conditions, the partnership agreement should always state the manner in
which the partners’ interests are to be adjusted. A common method, as
explained and illustrated in <a href="#Page_290">Chapter XXXIII</a>,
is to compute the average investment of each partner and to use these
amounts as the basis for profit-sharing. In this way the problem of
interest adjustment as such is completely eliminated.</p>

<p><b>Accretions of Capital through Profits.</b>—At the close of the
fiscal period, when results are summarized, the net profits are
transferred to the partners’ accounts. As the amount of profit left
in the business usually differs for different partners, it is evident
that the partners’ capital accounts at the end of the period will show
a different ratio from that existing at the beginning. Assume that a
given partnership consists of two members, A investing $2,000 and B
$1,000, and that profits are to be shared in the same ratio as these
original investments, i.e., 2:1; assume further that A withdraws the
greater part of his profits while B allows his share to accumulate, and
that at the end of a number of years the capital ratios have completely
changed, the capitals being, say, $8,000 for A and $24,000 for B.
Obviously, under such circumstances it would not be just for A still to
receive twice as much profit as B on the basis of the <i>original</i>
investment ratio of 2:1.</p>

<p>Whenever it is intended that profits are to be shared on the basis of
investments, the profit-sharing ratio should be changed from time to
time in order to correspond with actual investments, and this should be
plainly stated in the partnership agreement; or increments to capital
through the accretion of profits should be treated as temporary loans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
subject to withdrawals and bearing interest until withdrawn. It should
be the policy of the firm to offer an incentive to its members to
leave their surplus profits in the business and so prevent the need of
borrowing from outside.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be said that in the event of dissolution, accretions
through profits constitute claims against the firm ranking before
the partners’ capitals. Such accretions partake of the nature of
loans and for this reason they are sometimes carried in <i>partners’
loan accounts</i>, to keep them separate from the original capital
investments, or are left in the “Personal” accounts which are not then
closed into the “Capital” accounts.</p>

<p><b>Additional Contributions and Loans.</b>—When contributions are made
by partners there should be a specific understanding as to whether
such funds are to be considered as additional capital or as loans to
the partnership. In the first case the items should be shown in the
capital accounts of the partners, thus requiring a reconsideration of
the profit-sharing ratio—although a change is not always made; in the
second case they should be entered in the partner’s loan accounts with
corresponding interest adjustments, as has been explained.</p>

<p>Loans by partners may be evidenced by firm notes signed by all the
partners. However, these notes should not be carried in the regular
Notes Payable account because that account represents the firm’s
liability to outsiders, which must ordinarily be met promptly according
to the terms of the instrument. At common law a partner may not bring
suit against the firm of which he is a member; hence there is an
essential difference between these two kinds of notes. For this reason
a new account is opened entitled “Partners’ Notes Payable,” which is
credited whenever the firm issues a promissory note to any of its
members. Where the loan is not evidenced by a formal note, record
should be in the partner’s loan account. As stated on <a href="#Page_324">page 324</a>,
any loans made by partners to the business rank before regular capital
claims, and this priority is not changed when such loans are evidenced
by promissory notes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p><b>Partners’ Loans in Relation to Firm Credit.</b>—Loans made by
partners to the business may be viewed in two very different ways,
depending upon the credit rating of the firm. If there is distrust
as to the partners’ standing and financial condition, the fact that
they themselves, who know the real condition better than any outsider,
are willing to put additional capital into the business, is the best
evidence that the firm is not so badly off. Consequently, loans made by
partners under such conditions help to increase the firm’s credit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the integrity of any member of the firm is
questionable, his loans to the business do not necessarily increase
the credit of the firm; for in case of financial trouble he may
attempt secretly to withdraw part of the assets from the business and
to conceal the true condition of affairs from the creditors. Being on
the inside, he is in a position to do this before outsiders can even
scent trouble. Normally, however, the loan of a partner makes a better
impression than a loan from an outsider, since in case of insolvency
and dissolution the partner’s loan ranks <i>after</i> the claims of
outside creditors.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that in a partnership one or more of its members
lends the firm comparatively large amounts of money and accepts demand
notes as evidence of such loans. If the partner holding such a note is
unscrupulous, he may present it for payment at an unfavorable time and,
if the business is unable to pay, may demand an “accounting.” He may
even go so far as to cause its dissolution, repurchase the business at
much less than its true value and so “freeze out” his partners.</p>

<p><b>Borrowed Capital.</b>—It may happen that a firm is obliged to
borrow funds from outside in order to increase its working capital.
For instance, the partners may have no available private funds for
further investment and yet may not desire to admit new capital on a
profit-and-loss-sharing basis. Such loans usually are on a long-time
basis, and should not be included in the Notes Payable account. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
special account should be opened, e.g., Notes Payable Special,
Mortgage, or some other title plainly indicating the nature of the
loan. Sharp distinction should be made between funds borrowed for the
purpose of increasing the permanent capital, and money borrowed for
current needs. The need for additional current funds usually results
from seasonal fluctuations in business, slow collection of customers’
accounts, or slow movement of stock, and is met by current borrowing at
a bank; while the need for increased capital is caused by the original
capital investment being insufficient to meet present conditions.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">OTHER PARTNERSHIP PROBLEMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Admission of a New Partner.</b>—In <a href="#Page_290">Chapter XXXIII</a>
a distinction was made between buying out an interest in a business and
making an investment in a business. In the former case no new capital is
acquired, while in the latter the capital of the firm is increased by
the amount of the new partner’s contribution.</p>

<p>When a new partner is admitted he usually acquires not merely the right
to share in the profits, but he also obtains a share in the net worth
(often called “net assets”) of the enterprise. For this reason it is
necessary that all the partners, including the new member, agree on the
value of the net assets, and in this connection any of the following
possibilities may arise:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Upon admission of the new partner the book
accounts may be considered to represent the true status of the
business. A balance sheet is drawn up and the new partner is admitted
on the basis of the net worth it shows.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. It may be agreed that the assets are not
worth the amount at which they are carried on the books and that a new
valuation be placed upon them.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. The business may be considered to be worth
more than the amount shown by the balance sheet.</p>
</div>

<p><b>First Case.</b>—In the first case little difficulty is met in
making the opening entry admitting the new partner. For instance, if
the balance sheet shows a net worth of $30,000, and the new partner
wishes to make an investment in order to secure a one-fourth interest
in the firm, the amount to be contributed is manifestly $10,000.
Assuming that he makes a cash investment of $10,000, the following
entry meets all accounting requirements:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">  10,000.00</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>As a result of this cash investment of $10,000, the net worth of the
new firm is increased to $40,000 and the one-fourth interest belonging
to A is evidenced by his capital account at $10,000. The new firm may
now continue the old records and no further adjustments need be made.</p>

<p><b>Second Case.</b>—In the second case it is necessary to place a new
valuation upon the assets of the old firm and the accounts of the old
partners must be adjusted accordingly. For instance, suppose A and B
are equal partners and the financial status of the firm is shown by the
following balance sheet:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

<p>More capital is needed and C is invited to make an investment.
Upon investigation he finds that there are included under Accounts
Receivable many old items, of which it is estimated $1,000 will be
uncollectible; that the merchandise is overvalued to the amount of
$500; and that the building and equipment are worth $1,500 less than
is shown on the books. He offers to make an investment to secure a
one-fourth interest and his offer is accepted.</p>

<p>As a result of the new valuations placed upon the assets, the net
worth of the firm is now $18,000, against the old showing of $21,000.
Consequently, the capital accounts of A and B are reduced from $10,500
to $9,000 each. The new partner is to invest a certain sum sufficient
to acquire a one-fourth interest in the new business. Hence the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
combined capital of A and B, amounting to $18,000, will represent
three-fourths of the new capital, and consequently the amount to be
invested by C is $6,000. Thus the new capital of the firm will amount
to $24,000, one-fourth of which, or $6,000, is credited to C’s capital
account.</p>

<p>The firm has thus secured $6,000 additional capital, on a basis
somewhat unfavorable for the present, but inasmuch as the books now
show conservative values, no real injustice results.</p>

<p><b>Third Case.</b>—The third case shows the firm in a position to
demand something more than book values as the basis for admission of
the new partner. The presumption is that the old firm is favorably
known, has an established trade and patronage, built by fair dealing
and judicious advertising, by its favorable location, and the numerous
other ways in which a substantial business may be developed. Its
standing in the community is a factor of value to the firm because
it brings trade to its doors. Other conditions being equal, a firm
which enjoys a good reputation is worth more than a new venture. Such
a reputation is known as “good-will” and constitutes an exceedingly
valuable though an intangible asset. The essence of good-will is the
ability to produce more than normal profits, i.e., profits above the
average in that line. Consequently, whenever the members of a firm
consider the admission of a new partner, good-will is regarded as one
of the <i>assets</i> of the existing enterprise, thereby increasing its
net worth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>The valuation of good-will, however, is a difficult matter and it is
a well-established principle that good accounting will not allow the
asset good-will to be set up on the books of a concern unless it has
come into possession of it by purchase or unless a part of its own
good-will is sold to a new partner. In this case the price received for
the portion sold represents an outsider’s valuation and may therefore
become the basis for valuing the whole of it.</p>

<p>The following case will serve as an illustration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An outsider, R, is now to be admitted to a one-fifth interest by
making an investment in the business. The relative shares of the others
are to remain as before. Hence, after R’s admission, X will have
two-fifths, and Y, Z, and R one-fifth interest each. It is further
assumed that no revaluation of the tangible assets is necessary.</p>

<p>The net worth of the old firm, according to the books, is $40,000,
and if this were taken as the basis for admitting R, an investment of
$10,000 would be sufficient to acquire a one-fifth interest in the new
firm. However the business is considered to be worth $10,000 more than
the $40,000 shown in the balance sheet, and for this reason, instead of
paying $10,000, R is required to invest $12,500. The excess of $2,500
is paid by R as an offset to the shares of the others in the good-will
of the firm.</p>
</div>

<p>There are three ways of treating this good-will element, viz.:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">First Method.</span></b> Debit the Good-Will
account for the amount actually paid for it by R, viz., $2,500, and
credit the capital accounts of the old partners in proportion to their
shares in the profits:</p>

 </tbody>
</table>

<p>As a result of this entry, the capital account of X is $21,250,
and those of Y and Z $10,625 each. The capital account of R, however,
shows a credit of $12,500. In other words, R’s interest in the net
assets—although not in the profits—of the business as shown by his
account is <i>larger</i> than that of Y and Z, while as a matter of
fact he is to have an equal share. For this reason, this method of
treating good-will is not satisfactory.</p>

<p><b><span class="smcap">Second Method.</span></b> This method regards
the matter from a different standpoint. Taking book values as a basis,
the share bought by R is worth only $10,000. However, on account of
good-will, the real value of this share is considered to be higher and
R is required to pay $12,500 for it. Hence, in order that the books may
show actual values, the good-will item must be added to the assets of
the old firm, at the same time increasing the capital accounts of X, Y,
and Z in proportion to their shares in the profits. The entry is:</p>

<p>As a result of this adjustment the capital of the old firm is shown
as $50,000. R now invests $12,500, and the capital is thereby increased
to $62,500. The capital accounts of the four partners now show $25,000,
or two-fifths for X, and $12,500 or one-fifth each for Y, Z, and R.</p>

<p><b><span class="smcap">Third Method.</span></b> Under this method
of handling good-will, the extra $2,500 invested by R is treated as a
bonus for distribution among the members of the old firm, their capital
interests in the new firm remaining the same as in the old and R’s
appearing at $10,000. There is no objection to this method if R is
satisfied.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the three methods, the second usually proves the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>A similar problem involving the handling of good-will is encountered
when a member of an existing firm sells out his interest, including a
share of the good-will, to one who takes his place in the firm. Here
the transaction may be looked upon as a private deal between buyer and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
seller, in which case the buyer merely succeeds to the seller’s
interest in the firm, his capital appearing on the books at the same
amount as the seller’s former capital figure even though the new
partner pays more for it; or the good-will may be brought onto the
books and the capitals of all the partners be shown at increased
figures, as under the second method discussed above.</p>

<p><b>Consolidation of Partnerships.</b>—There are various reasons why
the consolidation of partnerships may be of mutual advantage to the
individual firms concerned. When two or more firms consolidate, the
competition which formerly existed between them is eliminated and
co-operation takes its place. Also by uniting their businesses, many
of the operations which were formerly performed separately are now
amalgamated with resulting savings. Many other advantages may result
from such consolidations.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the accountant, the consolidation of
partnerships is essentially the same as the admission of new partners,
the same principles applying to both. Before actual consolidation
takes place, it is necessary for each of the partnerships to place a
new valuation upon its assets and for all concerned to agree upon the
new figures. In almost all cases good-will is an important factor. The
valuation of good-will requires an investigation of the profits and
profit-earning capacity of the member firms. Conditions affecting the
profits of the various firms must be equalized as nearly as possible
so that the earning capacity of each can be compared on an equitable
basis. Such questions as the way in which partners’ salaries, interest
on capitals, withdrawals, and loans have been handled; the relation of
outside sources of income, if any, to the profit of any of the member
firms; and whether the consolidation contemplates taking over such
source of profits—these and similar questions must be considered and
treated equitably for all concerned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PARTNERSHIP PROFITS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Ambiguity of Definition of Profits.</b>—The term “profits” as
applied to business is perhaps used with as little uniformity as any
term met with. When a concern speaks of its profits, it is difficult
to know exactly what is intended, because the meaning of the term
depends very largely on the methods of accounting of that particular
concern. The reported profits of different firms are not, therefore,
a true basis for judging their relative worths. For instance, although
the net profits of a single proprietorship and of a partnership are
usually determined in the same manner, there is nevertheless variation
in the treatment of some items such as salaries, drawings, interest
on capital invested, etc. The partnership form, like the single
proprietorship, contemplates an investment on the part of the owners
not only of capital but also of time and effort. This is one of the
differences in working organization between these forms of business and
the corporation. Investment in the corporation is of capital only. If
services are employed by the corporation, they are paid for and charged
as services, salaries, etc.</p>

<p><b>Compensation for Time and Services.</b>—In the partnership form
of organization, the active and direct management of the business is
usually vested in the owners. Where this is not the situation, as in
a limited partnership, or whenever one or more of the partners does
not take an active part in the management of the business, his share
of the profit is usually curtailed by the allowance of salaries to the
managing partners before any distribution of profits in the agreed
ratio is made to the partners. Thus, partnership profits include not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
only the salaries of the owners but, in general, a recompense for the
time and ability of the proprietors. The man who makes an investment in
a partnership does so usually because he desires to invest his time as
well as his capital. He expects, therefore, to receive not only a fair
rate of interest on his money but also pay for the services he renders.</p>

<p><b>Interest on Investment.</b>—The rate paid for the use of money is
dependent both on the money market and on the element of risk involved
in the particular investment. In mining ventures, for instance, where
there is frequently considerable uncertainty as to the return of the
principal, the interest rate is sufficiently high to offset, during
the life of the loan, the possible loss of the principal at the end.
So an investor in a partnership, because of the greater element of
risk in comparison with other and safer investments, requires a higher
rate of return in interest than he would ordinarily secure through the
investment of his capital in sound securities.</p>

<p><b>Partnership Profits Defined.</b>—Partnership profits, therefore,
contain these two elements—interest and recompense for services.
If profits are extraordinary or above normal, such excess may be
and usually is the measure of the more-than-average ability of the
partners, unless it results from the monopolistic character of the
business.</p>

<p>In speaking of profits the term is used in a technical accounting sense
and has reference to the manner of their showing in the Profit and Loss
account and its content. That account or the Profit and Loss statement
usually develops a so-called “net profit” which is distributed to the
partners. Such profits are more easily defined by stating what should
not be considered in their determination, than by attempting to give an
itemized list of the income and expense items entering therein.</p>

<p>In accordance with the theory of the law of partnership, the net profit
of a partnership is the balance of the Profit and Loss account before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
interest on owners’ capital investments and the recompense to the
partners on account of time and services are taken into account. In
the accounting for an ordinary partnership, such items as interest
on capital investments, salaries to partners, etc., are not to be
considered as expense items to be deducted from profits before the
net earnings are determined, but as a part of the net profits to be
distributed to the several owners of the business. The payment of
salaries and interest on capital is made simply for the purpose of
distributing net profits according to certain methods agreed upon by
the members of the firm.</p>

<p><b>Profit and Loss for Comparative Purposes.</b>—For the purpose
of comparing results between different periods, the Profit and Loss
account should have a fairly uniform content from year to year. It
should set forth the amount of the net operating profit, in the
calculation of which account should be taken of all ordinary income and
expenses incurred in the operation of the business. This will provide
the basis for comparison, as between periods, of the ordinary normal
activities of the business.</p>

<p>In the “Non-Operating” or “Other Income” sections any
“outside-the-business” income and expense should be shown, such as
income from outside investments, and expenses in connection therewith.
Items of extraordinary income and expense, however, such as the profits
arising through the sale of good-will, the sale of real estate,
extraordinary losses from fire, etc., usually are taken directly into
the partners’ accounts so as not to destroy the value (for purposes of
comparison) of the results shown by the Profit and Loss account from
year to year.</p>

<p>In this way, while the purpose of the Profit and Loss account is to
summarize the temporary proprietorship accounts, some proprietorship
items may be omitted for the sake of making the summary of greater
value to the proprietors. Such a method of handling does not conflict
with principles previously laid down, but rests upon the general
principle that accounting methods and forms must be flexible in order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
to conform to the requirements of particular cases; else they fail in
fulfilling their full purpose.</p>

<p><b>Allowance of Salaries.</b>—The allowance of salaries to partners is
not so much for the purpose of measuring the excess of the profits of
the partnership over what the individual owners might have earned by
working for others, as it is for the purpose of equalizing or adjusting
their interests on an equitable basis. When, on the one hand, men
invest their abilities and services in addition to their capitals, and
on the other hand, the profit and loss-sharing ratio is determined on
the basis of capitals invested, the greater ability of a given partner
may be recognized and compensated by a salary. Thus a partner of
exceptional ability secures a larger share in the profits by receiving
a fixed amount under the head of salary, the remaining part of the
net profits being divided among all the partners in the profit and
loss-sharing ratio.</p>

<p><b>Allowance of Interest.</b>—As explained in <a href="#Page_290">Chapter XXXIII</a>,
it is not unusual in partnerships where the profit and loss ratio differs
from the capital ratio, to allow interest on capital. The effect of
such a provision is to secure a distribution of profits on a dual
basis, viz., a part as interest on the capitals in the capital ratio
and the remainder in the profit and loss ratio. Thus, two partners,
A and B, whose capitals are $10,000 and $15,000 respectively, with
a 6% interest allowance on capital and a subsequent half-and-half
distribution of profits, share the profits in effect on two different
bases. Suppose the profits are $6,000. The interest requirement will
give A $600 and B $900, after which $4,500 will be divided equally.
Interest on partners’ capitals is thus in no sense an operating expense
and should be handled always in the appropriation section of the Profit
and Loss.</p>

<p>If the partnership agreement makes specific provision (but not
otherwise), interest may be charged on partners’ drawings. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
merely an additional device for adjusting the partners’ interests, and
causes a slight difference in the net shares of profits. Where interest
is allowed on capitals and also charged on drawings, the partners’
accounts, Personal and Capital, when considered together, comprise
virtually an account current, and the interest computations may be made
as will be explained in <a href="#Page_468">Chapter L</a> in connection
with accounts current.</p>

<p>Another method of profit-sharing sometimes introduced in the
partnership agreement is the device of an interest allowance for a
contribution in excess of the agreed amount and an interest charge on
partners’ deficiency of capital. This method of equalizing unequal
investments, as illustrated in <a href="#Page_297">Chapter XXXIV</a>,
is a fair arrangement to all concerned.</p>

<p><b>Interest on Partners’ Loans.</b>—Careful differentiation must be
made between interest on partners’ capitals and on partners’ loans.
If a loan is secured from outside parties, its interest cost is a
business expense, to be taken into account before determining net
profits. A loan from a partner does not in the least change the manner
of showing its cost. Interest on partners’ loans is not, therefore,
to be handled in the appropriation section of the Profit and Loss
account, but should be charged to the regular Interest Cost account,
which is cleared in the regular way through Profit and Loss. The credit
is to Cash if actually paid, or to the partners’ personal accounts if
unpaid, although the amount is sometimes credited to the partners’ loan
accounts in order to secure a compounding of the interest.</p>

<p><b>Reserved Profits.</b>—In rare cases, before the partners’ shares in
the net profit are determined, a portion of it may be reserved for some
specific purpose. The portion so reserved is transferred from Profit
and Loss to some specified reserve account, to indicate the retention
of the profits in the business. If the profits were transferred to
the partners’ accounts, they would be subject to withdrawal from the
business. Even when shown in the reserve account, however, they belong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
to the proprietors and are just as much a part of the net worth of the
business as if credited to the proprietors’ accounts. Such reservation
of profits may be for the purpose of providing for the replacement of
some fixed asset when it wears out, as buildings, machinery, etc.,
or for meeting a liability when it comes due, or for some similar
purposes. Such reservations, however, are seldom made in partnership
accounting and a complete treatment of the subject is reserved for the
work of the second year in connection with corporation accounting.</p>

<p>It should be noted that reserves created from profits are not to be
confused with valuation accounts, such as reserves for depreciation
and doubtful accounts. Valuation accounts in no sense represent a
reservation of net profits. They represent the credit side of certain
asset accounts. The contra debits—to depreciation or bad debts—of
these credit reserves are expenses of the business which must be taken
into account before the amount of net profit can be determined.</p>

<p><b>Closing Profits to Partners’ Accounts.</b>—The disposition of
profits under a partnership does not differ materially from that under
the single proprietorship form. When the net profits are determined,
they belong to the proprietors and are usually transferred to their
accounts. The method of transfer may be either by way of the partners’
personal accounts or direct to the capital accounts. The principle
involved in either treatment was discussed at the time of closing the
books for the single proprietorship and will not be repeated here.
Where the partners do not desire to have any change shown in their
original capital accounts, the profits may be transferred to the loan
accounts of the partners or stand as open balances in their personal
accounts.</p>

<p><b>The Appropriation Section—Distributing a Deficit.</b>—The
appropriation section of the Profit and Loss account shows the
distribution of net profits to the partners’ accounts. A thorough
understanding of the partnership agreement is necessary before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
proper distribution can be made. If the agreement provides for salaries
and interest on capitals and drawings, these requirements must first
be met, even though the net profits are insufficient to satisfy them.
Their purpose, as explained above, is to equalize conditions and
interests among the partners preliminary to their sharing in the profit
and loss ratio. If this equalization results in a deficit, such deficit
will be distributed in the agreed ratio and to that extent nullify
some portion of the profits distributed as salaries and interest.
If specific provision in the articles of copartnership requires a
different handling of the salaries and interest items, that provision
of course governs. Otherwise these items should be treated as above.</p>

<p>If any of the partners leave profits in the business, this usually
results in a changing ratio of the capital account balances. Where the
distribution of profits is based upon the original contributions, it is
advisable to transfer the profits left in the business to separate loan
accounts for the partners. The partners’ capital accounts then always
show their original contributions.</p>

<p><b>Partners’ Withdrawals.</b>—Partners’ withdrawals and salaries are
usually handled in a very unsystematic way. The amount of the drawings
allowed each partner during a given period—week or month—should be
definitely determined by agreement, and regular checks should be issued
for these amounts. The payment of partners’ personal bills and the
handling of any other personal items should, as a matter of standard
practice, be made out of personal funds.</p>

<p>If the partnership agreement provides for salaries these should be
credited, when due, to the partners’ drawing accounts which will then
be charged with all actual drawings, whether for salary or otherwise.
The offsetting charge at the time the salary credit is made should be
to a “Partners’ Salaries” account, which at the close of the fiscal
period is closed into the appropriation section of the Profit and Loss
account, thereby showing in it the proper distribution of profits as salary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p><b>Profits Determination upon Admitting a New Partner.</b>—Particular
care should be taken to determine as nearly as possible the correct
net profit at the time of any change in the partners’ relations. Upon
the admission of a new partner, failure to make entry in the old
partners’ accounts of any profit rightfully belonging to them leads to
its being shared with the new partner and consequently results in a
loss to the old partners. In like manner the deferring of an expense
charge—rightfully belonging to the period before the admission of the
new partner—to the period after the admission, results in a wrongful
charge to the new partner. Similarly, when a partner is admitted on a
changing profit ratio basis (as when, for example, he is to receive a
one-fourth share for three years, at the end of which time he is to
have a one-third share), an incorrect determination of profits at the
end of the three-year period may mean a loss either to him or to the
old partners. So long as the same partnership and the same profit and
loss-sharing ratios continue, no injustice results through failure to
include some such items in their proper periods, as they are cumulative
and their effect will be recorded in later periods. However, this is no
excuse for the inaccurate determination of profits at any time.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">PARTNERSHIP DISSOLUTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Temporary Nature of Partnership.</b>—Because of its personal
character, a partnership has necessarily a limited duration. It must
look forward to the time when its business will have to be closed up.
The chief causes leading to a dissolution are briefly reviewed here.</p>

<p><b>Causes of Dissolution</b></p>

<p>1. The withdrawal of any partner. Under ordinary circumstances a
partner cannot be held to a specific performance of his contract. If
he becomes dissatisfied, suspicious, or desires for other reasons to
withdraw from his contract before its expiration, he has that power.
Such withdrawal cannot be looked upon as a right but only as a power
to be exercised under unusual circumstances. If his withdrawal before
the agreement terminates results in damage to his copartners, they
have a lawful claim against him for the amount of the damage. Under
extraordinary conditions, specific performance of the contract might
be decreed, i.e., the partner would not be allowed to withdraw.</p>

<p>Withdrawal does not relieve a partner from liability for partnership
debts incurred while he was a member of the firm. Any creditors not
paid by the firm may hold the withdrawing partner liable for the debts.
To be relieved from the liability on debts arising <i>after</i> his
withdrawal, personal notice of withdrawal must be given to all the
firms with which the partnership has been dealing; a published notice
being considered sufficient for the parties not dealing with the firm
until after withdrawal.</p>

<p>2. Sale of a partner’s interest or admission of a new partner. When
a partner, with the consent of his copartners, sells his interest in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
firm to another, or when a new member is admitted to the partnership,
in the eyes of the law the old partnership has ceased to exist and a
new one has taken its place.</p>

<p>3. Limitations in the partnership agreement. The agreement may specify
the period for which the partnership is to exist. If it is a special
partnership, the object it is to accomplish may be stated and the law
considers the firm automatically dissolved as soon as that object is
attained.</p>

<p>4. Mutual consent of the partners. Whether or not the partnership
period is limited by the agreement, the partners may at any time
rescind their contract by mutual consent.</p>

<p>5. Misconduct, insanity, death, assignment, or bankruptcy of a partner.
The happening of any of these contingencies effects a dissolution.
By misconduct may be understood a member’s failure to pay the agreed
contribution of capital, failure to perform his duties, his acting in
bad faith towards his copartners, etc.</p>

<p>6. Illegal object. A partnership entered into for the pursuit of an
object which later becomes illegal is automatically dissolved.</p>

<p>7. War between nations of which partners are citizens. This dissolves
the partnership, though such dissolution may be more in the nature of a
suspension, inasmuch as the relation may be resumed upon cessation of
hostilities.</p>

<p>8. Bankruptcy of the firm. This results in the firm’s assets being sold
to satisfy the claims of its creditors and the firm as such ceases to
exist.</p>

<p>9. Sale or transfer. A firm may sell out to another firm or change its
form of organization to that of a corporation. The old firm, therefore,
no longer exists.</p>

<p><b>Problems Incident to Dissolution.</b>—It is purposed to consider
some of the problems involved in winding up the affairs of a
partnership. From the schedule of causes of dissolution given above it
will be seen that a firm may be either solvent or insolvent at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
dissolution. The three statements sometimes set up in the case of
insolvency—the Statement of Affairs, the Deficiency Account, and the
Realization and Liquidation Statement—will not be explained here
but results obtained through them will be taken into account. These
statements are seldom met in practice and are not standardized either
as to form or content. Their treatment is deferred to the work of the
second year.</p>

<p><b>Partnership Provisions Covering Liquidation.</b>—Because of the
certainty of final dissolution, it is not unusual for the partnership
agreement to make definite regulations concerning the method of
liquidation. The appointment of one of the members as liquidating
partner, the manner of distributing the proceeds from liquidation
whether by instalments or otherwise, the manner of paying the liquidator
for his services—all these contingencies should be provided for.</p>

<p>Where dissolution is forced by the death of one of the partners, to
determine the interest of his heirs it is necessary to take inventory
and make appraisal of the firm’s assets. To avoid this inconvenience
to the business, provision is sometimes made in the agreement that the
remaining partners shall continue the business until the end of the
regular fiscal period. The deceased partner’s share in the profits
for the current period up to the date of his death is determined by
prorating the year’s profit over the period in which the deceased had
an interest. The method of calculating the firm’s good-will is usually
provided for in the partnership agreement so that the estate of the
deceased partner will share in it also. Usually interest is allowed the
estate of the deceased partner from the date of his death until the
settlement of his share.</p>

<p><b>Partners’ Rights and Procedure During Liquidation.</b>—When
dissolution is accompanied by liquidation, as happens in many
instances, all the partners have an equal right to share in the work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
of liquidation. Since the work usually does not require the time of all
the partners, a customary procedure is to appoint one member—or an
outsider—as the liquidator. Notice of the dissolution, in which
the name of the liquidator is given, is published in the leading
newspapers. If liquidation is necessary because of the death of a
partner, great responsibility rests upon the liquidator. He must act
in strict good faith and endeavor to realize the best price possible
for the assets of the firm in the interest of the deceased partner’s
estate. A similar responsibility rests upon him when liquidation is
carried on in the interest of absent members.</p>

<p>The expenses and losses incident to liquidation must be borne by all
in the profit and loss ratio. The liquidator may be paid either by
means of a commission on the sums realized or by a salary. If the
liquidator is a partner, settlement may take place privately between
the partners but usually his commission or salary is charged to the
firm’s liquidation expenses.</p>

<p>Liquidation may proceed by sale of the assets in regular order and may
even permit the purchase of additional goods where necessary to fulfil
existing contracts or to complete partly manufactured goods, or where
stock on hand can be disposed of to better advantage by the addition of
side lines or specialties.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Proceeds.</b>—Upon the realization of the assets,
application of the proceeds must be made in the following order: First,
the claims of outside creditors must be met in full or by compromise
where not fully recognized. Second, the claims of the partners on
account of loans or advances made to the firm must be satisfied.
Third, the partners share in the remainder, by first taking out their
respective capital contributions and then, if there is a balance, by
sharing it in their profit and loss ratios. If there is a loss, this
must be shared in the profit and loss ratio before withdrawal of any
capital contributions. The remainder, if any, is divided among the
partners in the ratio of their capitals as diminished by the loss.
Whether the net assets are either more or less than the total amount of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
the capitals, the difference is shared in the profit and loss ratio,
and what remains is shared in the capital ratio. If a careful
accounting is made of the profit or loss at the time of the sale of
each piece of property and these profits and losses together with the
dissolution expenses are summarized and distributed to the partners’
capital accounts, those accounts will of course show the claims of the
various partners on the net assets of the business after all assets
have been converted into cash and all liabilities paid.</p>

<p>Instead of a complete liquidation of the firm’s assets, certain of the
assets may, by mutual consent, be taken over by each partner at agreed
values and applied toward the satisfaction of his capital and loan
interests. Such use of assets is spoken of as a <i>conversion</i> to
that particular purpose. It must be distinctly understood that this is
not a right which any partner can demand, but only a privilege granted
by the mutual agreement of the partners. Any partner can demand that
all the assets be sold and that the proceeds be applied in satisfaction
of the interests concerned.</p>

<p><b>Sharing Losses.</b>—In the case of insolvency, the partners are
compelled to share the losses in the profit and loss ratio, not in
capital ratio, and these losses are chargeable against their capital
accounts. If the capital account of any of the partners is not large
enough to satisfy his share in the losses, a deficit in that partner’s
interest results, which is represented by the debit balance in his
capital account. This shows the amount which he must contribute to
the firm in order that all claims may be satisfied. The rule that
profits and losses in liquidation cannot be shared in the same ratio
as capitals, unless this ratio is also the profit and loss ratio, is
responsible for the fact that upon dissolution one or more partners may
have to make additional contributions, while others may not be obliged
to do so. This duty of contributing to make up a deficit is inherent in
the partnership relation and can be enforced by the copartners.</p>

<p>A few illustrations will set forth the main problems in connection
with the liquidation of partners’ capitals:

<p>The above balance sheet shows, in summary form, the condition of the
firm previous to liquidation, and also indicates the shares of the
partners in the net assets as on that date, i.e., the partners share
in the net assets in the ratio 15:20:25 or 3:4:5. Dissolution becomes
necessary and in the course of liquidation the expenses and losses
incurred amount to $15,000. After the net loss of $15,000 is divided
equally among the partners, the capitals will amount to, A $10,000,
B $15,000, and C $20,000. The result is that the capital ratio has
changed from 3:4:5 to 10:15:20, or 2:3:4, and the net assets of $45,000
are to be shared in this new ratio.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Jones and Smith share profits and losses equally.</p>

<p>The above balance sheet shows the condition of the firm after
liquidation. It is necessary, first, to distribute the liquidation
losses among the partners, after which they share in the net assets
according to capital ratios. Accordingly, each capital account is
debited with an equal share in the loss of $15,000, after which Jones’
capital is $12,500 and Smith’s account shows a debit balance of $2,500.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
This means that Jones not only gets the entire cash of $10,000, but
Smith must contribute $2,500 to the firm and this also goes to Jones.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Smith and Jones each have a <big>⅖</big> share
and Green a <big>⅕</big> share in profits and losses.</p>

<p>The above balance sheet shows the financial condition of the firm after
taking into consideration the losses incident to liquidation. From
this it is seen that Jones owes the business $9,000. Assume that he
is personally insolvent and cannot contribute the share due from him.
The net assets available for distribution consist of $16,000 in cash.
Inasmuch as Jones’ interest is entirely wiped out and a contribution
is due from him which he cannot pay, the amount of that contribution
is an additional loss to be borne by the two remaining partners. Their
respective shares in this loss are determined by their original profit
and loss ratios ⅖ and ⅕, so that as between themselves Smith must bear
⅔ of the loss or $6,000, and Green ⅓ or $3,000; after which Smith’s
capital and share in the net assets is $9,000, and Green’s $7,000.</p>

<p>Where a partner, in his private capacity, and the firm of which he is
a member are both bankrupt, his personal creditors have first claim on
his personal estate and the firm’s creditors on the assets of the firm.</p>

<p><b>Distribution by Instalments.</b>—Where the liquidation is of long
duration, the partners may desire to receive what is due them by
instalments rather than wait to receive their respective shares in one
amount. Where the capital ratio differs from the profit and loss ratio,
it is difficult to determine the proper ratio in which the instalments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
should be paid, due to the fact that expenses and losses have not
yet been determined. Consequently it is impossible to tell what
the ultimate ratios will be in which the partners are to share the
net assets. As the payment of instalments on an arbitrary basis
might result ultimately in an overpayment of some partners and an
underpayment of others, the only safe method of handling the situation
is to pay the first instalments to those partners whose capital ratios
are in excess of their profit and loss ratios until their capitals are
reduced to the point where the capital ratios of all the partners are
the same as their profit and loss ratios. As soon as this point is
reached, the proceeds of the assets may be distributed to the partners
on the basis of their profit and loss ratios, because these are now
identical with their capital ratios. A more complete treatment of this
problem will be found on pages 650 to 654 of the author’s second volume.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Good-Will upon Liquidation by Sale.</b>—When
dissolution is brought about by the sale of the entire business, it may
happen that the amount realized on the assets is smaller than their
book value, and the difference must be treated as a loss in accordance
with the principles previously stated. Similarly, where the assets are
sold and the price realized is larger than their book value, the excess
constitutes a profit and must be distributed among the partners in
profit and loss ratio. Usually such an excess is treated as a receipt
on account of good-will, and two standard methods of booking it are
employed. When good-will is mentioned in the sale contract and its
value has been determined, it is brought on the books as an asset and
transferred immediately to the partners’ accounts. Thus, if the value
is $15,000 and the profit and loss ratio is <big>⅖</big> to A, <big>⅖</big>
to B, and <big>⅕</big> to C,
the entry is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
Good-will is now shown as an asset, and the entry closing it off is the
same as for the sale of the other assets, viz., a debit to Cash and a
credit to Good-Will.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when good-will is not specified as such in the sale
contract, but the amount realized on the sale of the assets is larger
than their book values, this excess may be credited to Good-Will, which
is then treated not as an asset account (as in the case given above)
but as a profit and loss account. The balance of this account is closed
out to the partners’ accounts in profit-sharing ratios in the same way
as above. The ultimate result is the same in either case; the first
method is a little more complete since it shows the value of the asset
good-will previous to its sale.</p>

books, whether single proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, are

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE CORPORATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Definition.</b>—The definition of a corporation, given by
former Chief Justice Marshall as “an artificial being, invisible,
intangible, and existing only in contemplation of the law,” sets forth
its fundamental characteristics, viz., artificial personality and
creation by the law. Blackstone says, “A corporation is an artificial
person created for preserving in perpetual succession certain rights
which being conferred on natural persons only would fail in the
process of time.” Blackstone’s definition lays particular emphasis
on a characteristic not specifically mentioned by Marshall, that of
perpetuity of succession. It is apparent that the corporation within
the limits prescribed by statute has most of the attributes and powers
of a person—it can sue and be sued, can hold and pass title to property,
real and personal, can carry on business in its own name, is responsible
to the extent of its entire property for the payment of its debts, etc.</p>

<p><b>Growth of the Corporate Form of Organization.</b>—The corporate
form of organization is being increasingly utilized for the conduct of
business of almost every kind. It offers a much more attractive field
to the investor who desires to place his surplus funds in productive
enterprises and share in their profits without having the burdens
of active management or the risk of losing his private fortune to
satisfy the claims of business creditors should the undertaking prove
unsuccessful. Just as the partnership is an advance over the sole
proprietorship in point of business organization, efficiency, and
ability to cope with larger undertakings, so the corporation in some of
its forms represents an advance over the partnership form of business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
organization. Its advantages and disadvantages in comparison with the
partnership will be reviewed briefly.</p>

<p><b>Advantages.</b>—Some of its advantages are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Limited liability. Only corporation property
can be levied on to satisfy the claims of creditors; the private
fortunes of the individual stockholders cannot be touched.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Continued existence. The death, withdrawal, or
bankruptcy of any of its members does not interfere with its existence.
Its life may be terminated by voluntary dissolution, insolvency,
expiration of charter life, forfeiture of charter to the state for
misuse, non-use, or abuse of its privileges.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Transferability of its shares, and their use
as collateral for private loans without injury to the credit of the
corporation.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. Larger capital. A partnership becomes unwieldy
and inefficient if the number of partners becomes too large. The number
of stockholders in a corporation is not limited and varies from one
to many thousands in the larger corporations. Accordingly much more
extensive fields of endeavor are open to the corporation because it can
bring together and use advantageously the combined capitals of many
persons.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. Centralized control. Its method of internal
organization is such that one man can be made the responsible head
instead of the many heads of the partnership.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Disadvantages.</b>—The chief disadvantages of the corporation may
be summarized thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Comparative absence of personal interest
of the managing officer. This is largely a theoretical drawback,
inasmuch as it is usually required that the managing officer be a
stockholder.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. As a creature of the state, the corporation is
subject to state legislative control. It is taxable by the state and is
required to make periodic reports.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Its credit is dependent on the amount of its
net assets and not on the fortunes of its individual owners.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. Corporations are sometimes restricted as
to the character of their business. In some states certain lines of
business cannot be carried on by corporations.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. In some states it is illegal for corporations
to hold stock in other corporations.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
In spite of these and other disadvantages, most of which are not
serious, the advantages of the corporate form of organization far
surpass those of the sole proprietorship or partnership.</p>

<p><b>The Formation of a Corporation.</b>—Formerly a corporation could
be brought into existence only by a special act of the legislature.
As this method proved cumbersome and was subject to much abuse, it
gave place in all states to general corporation statutes or enabling
acts whereby an application in due form and according to statutory
provisions is all that is necessary for organizing a corporation.
Though the statutes differ for each state, they are uniform in the main
points. The method of formation under the New York statute will be
explained.</p>

<p><b>Certificate of Incorporation—New York State.</b>—The form of
application for a charter to do business as a corporation is known
as a “certificate of incorporation.” This document must be prepared
by at least three natural persons, two-thirds of which number
must be citizens of the United States and at least one of whom
must be a citizen of New York State. These persons are called the
“incorporators.” Their certificate must be made out in the English
language, signed by each incorporator, acknowledged before a notary
public, and must contain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The name of the corporation, in the English
language. This must be different from the name of any other domestic or
foreign corporation doing business in the state and must not contain in
its title the words, “bank, trust, insurance, etc.”</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. The purpose or purposes for which it is
created. There is practically no limitation as to the lines of endeavor
the corporation may declare itself desirous of following, with the
exception that banks, trust, transportation, and insurance companies,
etc., come under special laws.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. The amount of capital stock of the
corporation, common and preferred if both are to be issued. Preferred
stock of various classes may be authorized after incorporation. The
minimum amount of capital required by the New York law is $500.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
One-half of the capital must be paid in within one year from the date
of incorporation. The certificate must state also the amount of capital
to be paid in before the corporation can commence business and this
must not be less than $500. No debts can be contracted before that
amount is paid in.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. The number of shares into which the authorized
capital is divided and the par value of each. This must not be less
than $5 nor more than $100, although more recently capital stock has
been authorized with no named par value.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. The place in which the principal office is to
be located, which must be within the state.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">6. The contemplated duration of its life. This
may be made perpetual.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">7. The number of directors, which must not be
less than three.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">8. The names and post-office addresses of the
directors for the first year. Directors usually are stockholders and at
least one-fourth of the directors are subject to election annually.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">9. The names and post-office addresses of the
subscribers to the certificate of incorporation, and the number of
shares in the corporation subscribed by each.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Filing the Certificate—New York State.</b>—The certificate of
incorporation is usually made out in triplicate. The original must
be filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of State; the
duplicate certified by the Secretary must be filed with the clerk of
the county in which the principal business office is to be located;
and the certified triplicate is retained by the corporation in its own
files. The fees for filing the certificate with the Secretary of State
are $10, and for recording 15 cents per folio. The county clerk’s fees
are 6 cents per folio for filing.</p>

<p><b>Organization Tax—New York State.</b>—Before the filing of the
certificate, an organization tax of 1/20th of 1% of the authorized
capital stock must be paid to the State Treasurer. Record of this
payment is forwarded to the Secretary’s office.</p>

<p><b>Initial Acts of Corporation.</b>—When the corporation is ready to
commence business, its first act is usually to call a meeting of the
incorporators and directors for the purpose of adopting a set of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
by-laws—although this matter may be delegated to the board of
directors. This meeting also authorizes the issue of stock at or above
par in exchange for cash, labor, or property.</p>

<p><b>State Control.</b>—The outside control of the corporation is
vested in the state. The state constitution, the general corporation
law, the statutes relating to business organizations in general, and
the specific contract between the corporation and state embodied in
its charter or certificate of incorporation—these form the basis for
state control and the limits within which the corporation may act as
an authorized person. If the corporation does an interstate business,
it is subject also to the regulations of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.</p>

<p><b>Working Organization and Management.</b>—The corporation’s owners,
that is, the stockholders, are the source of all authority and control.
Unlike the partnership where control and voice in the management are
equally shared by the partners regardless of any inequality in their
investments, the corporation ownership is evidenced by shares of stock
and each share is given one vote. Thus each owner’s authority and
voting power are dependent upon the amount of his ownership of stock.
He has, however, the right to delegate this power to another person by
“power of attorney,” and in this way it frequently happens that one
stockholder exercises a power far beyond the amount of shares owned
by him. Delegation of voting power frequently occurs when the stock
is widely distributed geographically and is owned in small lots. In
theory the agent or attorney entrusted with the voting power of others
is simply carrying out the will of his principal, the real owner of the
stock.</p>

<p><b>Annual Election of Directors.</b>—Because of the number of
stockholders and because many of them are engaged in other pursuits,
one of the characteristics of the corporate form of management is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
the owners frequently do not have direct control of their enterprise.
Accordingly, at regular times, usually annually, the stockholders elect
directors to whom are delegated the general oversight and control of
the business. The board of directors thus elected stands in the place
of the stockholders during the period between the annual meetings at
which it renders account of its management.</p>

<p><b>Officers.</b>—The board of directors elects officers of the
company—usually a president, vice-president, treasurer, and
secretary—to undertake the active management of the business; or the
directors may appoint a general manager or superintendent on whom rests
the active management and who is the executive head of the corporation.
Thus the chief characteristic of the working organization of the
corporation is the delegation of authority to a responsible head. The
accountability of the officers to the board of directors, and of the
directors to the stockholders, has so far proved the most efficient
method of conducting modern business.</p>

<p><b>The Showing of Proprietorship.</b>—The chief difference, from an
accounting viewpoint, between the corporate form and other forms of
business organization is in the showing of proprietorship. Vested
proprietorship in a sole owner or partnership business is carried under
the title of the different owners’ capital accounts, and credit is
extended by the public to such owners, not on the basis of what the
particular business is worth, but on the reputation of the owners and
what they are known to be worth outside the business as well as in
the business. On the other hand, the law has relieved the owners of a
corporation of individual liability for the debts of the corporation.
Only the corporate property can be held liable for the satisfaction of
creditors’ claims. For their protection, the corporation is not allowed
to impair its capital stock by the payment of any portion of it in
dividends to the owners or to change the amount of its capital stock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
without special authority. The outstanding capital stock, in theory,
represents to the prospective creditor the minimum value of the
corporation assets which are supposed to be sufficient to meet in full
the claims of creditors. Accordingly, the portion of the capital of a
corporation represented by its capital stock is a fixed amount, and
the increments or decrements of proprietorship are usually shown in a
separate account called Surplus. This account must always be read with
the Capital Stock account to ascertain the current or present capital
as distinguished from the original.</p>

<p>The Surplus account is sometimes divided and shown under such titles
as Profits, Reserves, Undivided Profits, Working Capital, etc. To
ascertain full proprietorship or net worth, all such accounts must be
included.</p>

<p class="f120"><b><span class="smcap">Records Peculiar to a Corporation</span></b></p>

<p><b>The Subscription Book and Subscription Ledger.</b>—Upon the proper
filing and acceptance of the certificate of incorporation, authority is
given the incorporators to secure subscriptions to the capital stock.
Subscription books or blanks may then be opened, which usually contain
a form of agreement somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">We, the undersigned, do hereby subscribe for and
agree to take the number of shares of the capital stock of the Blank
Company, par value ........ set opposite our names and pay for the
same, ........ per centum down, the remainder subject to the call of
the board of directors.</p>

<p>Where the number of subscribers is large and especially if record must
be made of the payment of calls, a Subscription Ledger or Instalment
Book is used. This ledger has no set form but usually carries columns
showing when the calls are to be made, when actually made, when paid,
and the balance still due. A controlling account called “Subscribers”
or “Subscription” is carried on the general ledger, with a special
column in the cash book to gather the totals for posting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p><b>The Stock Certificate Book and Stock Ledger.</b>—A subscriber
is, as such, a stockholder in the corporation even though his stock
certificate may not yet have been issued to him. The stock certificate
is merely evidence of ownership. It is usually issued from a book with
perforated leaves similar to a check book, with stub to carry the
essential data of the certificate. Directly from this stub, or through
the medium of a stock journal, postings are made to the individual
accounts in the stock ledger. This ledger which, in turn, is controlled
by the Capital Stock account or accounts on the general ledger, carries
the detailed information as to the number of shares issued, shares
canceled, and balances held by each owner.</p>

<p><b>The Stock Transfer Book.</b>—In the state of New York a stock
transfer book must be kept, showing all the data in connection with
transfers of shares, such as old and new stock certificate numbers,
names of the parties, etc.</p>

<p><b>The Minute Book.</b>—To preserve a record of the meetings of the
directors and stockholders, and the business transacted thereat,
use is made of a minute book kept by the secretary. This book, as
the source of authority for all the important acts and policies of
the corporation, is a most important record. The record should be a
complete history of the corporation from its organization through the
entire period of its existence.</p>

<p><b>Other Records.</b>—When the stock is sold on the instalment plan,
formal receipt of the payment of each instalment is sometimes made by
means of an “Instalment Scrip Book,” whose certificates or receipts
are issued upon payment of each instalment. When full payment has
been made, the instalment certificates are exchanged for the regular
certificates of stock. A dividend book for recording the payment of
dividends is sometimes kept, though the need for such a record has been
largely eliminated through the use of dividend checks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">OPENING THE CORPORATION BOOKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Corporation Accounting Records.</b>—The method of recording the
ordinary business transactions of a corporation is essentially the
same as in the types of business organization previously discussed.
The opening and closing of corporation accounts, however, as also the
method of making the periodic summarization, call for the special
treatment given in this chapter and the next.</p>

<p><b>Proprietorship and Capital Stock.</b>—As stated before, the members
of a stock corporation have their ownership evidenced by certificates
of stock. The proprietorship or net worth of a corporation, as of
the single proprietorship and partnership, is the excess of its
assets over its liabilities. This excess is shown in the books by two
accounts or two groups of accounts, viz., the Capital Stock account—or
accounts—which represents the amount of outstanding shares; and
the Surplus account—subdivided and carried under other titles, if
desirable—which represents the excess of the proprietorship over the
amount of capital stock. Each stockholder’s share in the corporation is
determined by the number of shares he possesses.</p>

<p><b>Common and Preferred Stock.</b>—There may be various classes of
stock. If only one kind is authorized at the beginning, the subsequent
creation of other kinds requires an amendment of the charter. The usual
classes of stock are common and preferred. As its name indicates,
preferred stock has some kind of preference over the common or ordinary
stock. This preference may be only in regard to dividends, or it
may include preference as to ownership in the net assets in case of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
dissolution. Preferred stock usually carries a fixed dividend, payable
before any dividend can be paid to the common stockholders.</p>

<p>Preferred stock is classified as cumulative and non-cumulative. The
terms apply to the dividend liability of the corporation in the event
that the continuity of dividend declarations is broken. The dividend
on cumulative preferred stock accumulates and becomes a preferred
claim for the amount accumulated since the time of the last dividend
declaration. That is, the common shareholders are not entitled to
receive any dividend until the preferred shareholders have received the
amount of the accumulated total. Preferred stock that is non-cumulative
does not possess this feature. A dividend once passed on such stock is
not a preferred claim to profits as compared with the dividend rights
of common stockholders, but lapses completely. Preferred stock is
cumulative unless specified to the contrary.</p>

<p>The issue of No-par-value stock is authorized by thirteen different
states. Very often in a corporation whose stock carries a stated par
value, there is little real relationship between the actual value of
the stock as indicated by the net assets of the corporation and its
stated par value. The law requires that par-value stock be carried on
the books at its stated par. If such stock has been sold or exchanged
for assets of a lesser value, there is always the temptation to inflate
the value of the assets in order to maintain it at the par of the
stock issued for them. This tendency is not met in the use of stock
carrying no par value. Such stock appears on the books at exactly the
amount of the assets received in exchange for it. A purchaser of such
stock, because of the fact that it carries no stated par value, is at
once put on notice to investigate the values back of it. No-par-value
stock may be either preferred or common. In the former instance, if the
preference relates to the assets at the time of dissolution, each such
share must state the amount of assets applicable to each share in case
of liquidation of the corporation. This constitutes a preference claim,
not over the creditors of the corporation, but only over the common
stockholders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>Thus it is seen that there may be different classes of ownership of a
corporation, the owners of one class having some advantages over the
owners of the other classes. It should be understood, of course, that
within each class the rights and duties of the owners are the same.</p>

<p><b>Opening the Books of a Corporation.</b>—The opening entries of
a corporation have to do with a correct treatment of capital stock,
subscriptions, calls and instalments, payments by cash and by property,
etc.</p>

<p>The charter to do business, granted a corporation by the state, gives
it the right to sell shares of stock. These shares have no value in
themselves and are worth only what the corporation can exchange them
for, either in cash or other assets. There is, therefore, no reason
for making a record on the books of account as distinguished from
the corporation’s minute book, of the corporation’s right to issue
stock and of the amount of the stock which it has a right to issue.
Until the stock has been paid or subscribed for, no formal entry
need be made on the books of account. Of course, full record of all
deliberations and resolutions as to procedure and policy up to the time
of the actual sale of the stock is carried in the minute book, and a
concise narrative statement of the organization of the corporation, its
purposes, the authorized capital stock issue, the number of shares,
the par value of each share, if par value stock, and so forth, should
always precede the formal opening entries in the journal. This record
and that in the minute book should give all the information of this
sort needed. There is a too prevalent tendency among bookkeepers
to make all sorts of memorandum entries on the books of account. A
memorandum entry is an entry which has no financial significance and is
made merely as a reminder that transactions of financial significance
may arise from that source.</p>

<p>Before a corporation can secure its charter it is necessary to make
certain expenditures. These usually consist of fees paid to a lawyer
for his services in assisting in drawing up the charter; fees for filing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
the certificate; the organization tax; the cost of the certificates of
stock and stock records; and so forth. These expenditures must be met
by the incorporators from their private funds but they are reimbursed
from the funds received upon sale of the stock. It is, accordingly,
customary in opening the books of a corporation to show first the sale
of the stock before showing the expenditures for organization.</p>

<p>A number of different methods of opening the books are employed. The
first of these does not make use of the memorandum entries referred
to above, whereas the other two do use memorandum entries. The three
methods will be illustrated by means of the problem given below. The
entries are shown in journal form. It will be understood, of course,
that those entries which involve cash will appear in the cash book
only. All the other entries appear in the general journal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

The Smith-Brown Company is incorporated with an authorized capital
stock of $250,000, of which $150,000 is subscribed and paid for at par;

<p>Entry (a) is a memorandum entry recording the amount of capital
stock authorized by the corporation’s charter. This entry has little or
no financial significance. Not until stock is sold does the corporation
have any real assets.</p>

<p>Entry (b) shows that of the stock which was unissued under entry
(a), $150,000, has been subscribed for, thus giving the corporation a
legally enforcible claim—an asset—for that amount.</p>

<p>Entry (c) is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Entry (d) shows the issue of the stock when the subscriptions are
paid.</p>

<p>Entry (e) adjusts the memorandum entry (a), to show the present
amount of authorized stock still unissued, viz., $100,000. Both
accounts under (a) continue as memoranda only, and as they exactly

<p>This method also makes use of memorandum accounts before the sale

be noted. It will be seen that the credit of entry (a) is here Capital
Stock instead of Capital Stock Authorized. This is theoretically
incorrect because as yet the corporation has no proprietorship. The
best that can be said for it is that the debit represents a contingent
asset and the credit a contingent proprietorship item. The other
entries are self-explanatory.</p>

<p><b>Premium or Discount on Stock.</b>—The law requires that when stock
of par value is issued, the Capital Stock account must be carried
always at par. When stock is sold at a premium or at a discount, it
necessitates, therefore, the use of supplementary proprietorship
accounts to make the proper record. In the state of New York, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
corporation cannot sell its stock at a discount, but in states where
this is allowed the amount of such discounts should be charged to a
“Discount on Stock” or some similar account. Sometimes the charge
is made to “Organization Expense.” The use of Organization Expense
account for this purpose is contrary to the principle that the account
title should show the exact nature of the items recorded under it. It
is misleading and sometimes reprehensible. A full discussion of this
matter is given in Volume II. When stock is sold above par, the amount
of the premium is recorded in the account “Premium on Stock,” which
as usually handled constitutes a part of the permanent capital of the
corporation. Premiums on stock sales should not be credited to Surplus
account. The following illustration will show the kind of entries
required:</p>

<p>Discount on capital stock should usually be shown as above, although
one sometimes finds it listed among the assets on a balance sheet. This
is not wholly objectionable unless it is set up under a title which
does not indicate its true nature.</p>

<p><b>Instalments.</b>—The subscription contract sometimes provides for
payment by instalments. The corporation usually issues to all such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
subscribers a “call,” i.e., a notice that an instalment payment will
come due at a given time. The subscriber is not considered delinquent
until the call has been made and he has not responded. The accounts
must therefore reflect the difference in status brought about by a
“call.” This is accomplished by transferring the claim against the
subscriber carried in Subscribers account to a new claim against him
carried under Call account. The illustrations below show the accounts
required and their handling.</p>

<p>If the call is not paid in full at balance sheet time, the debit
balance in the “Call” accounts constitutes an asset, i.e., the amount

<p><b>Entries for No-Par Stock.</b>—When a corporation issues no-par
stock, the amount of proprietorship resulting from its sale is exactly
what the stock brings and is so recorded; there is neither discount nor
premium. Booking it is, therefore, simple. The amount of capital so
secured, i.e., secured from its sale, should, however, never be mixed
with the accretions to capital from reserved profits or other sources.
Such items constitute the Surplus just as in the case of stock of par
value, and the legal requirement that these amounts be kept separate
from the capital stock are just as strict. This is necessary so that
the records will clearly show that dividends have not encroached
upon the capital. Since the value at which no-par stock is carried
on the books bears no relation to the number of shares issued, it is
customary to carry on the balance sheet information as to the number
of shares outstanding. The net worth section of the balance sheet of a
corporation issuing no-par stock should appear as follows:

<p><b>Payment of Subscriptions by Property.</b>—When payment of
subscriptions is by property instead of by cash, the value at which
such property shall be brought onto the books is entirely at the
discretion of the corporation’s directors, and unless fraud can be
shown, their valuations are final. No difficulties are involved in
recording such a payment; the paid properties are debited under
suitable account titles, and the Subscribers account is credited.

<p>Where the stock is issued to each partner directly (instead of to
the firm and then distributed to the vendors), sometimes the issue is
not shown on the partnership books, entry (c) above carrying debits to
the partner’s capital accounts in place of the debit to American Baking
Company Stock. Whether the actual transaction follows one course or the
other, entries as shown above seem to meet either requirement.</p>

<p>The student should make sure that the effect of the entries under
(a) and (b) is thoroughly understood. It may be further noted that if
good-will or shrinkage of values enters into the sale of a partnership,
the necessary adjustments should be made in the partners’ accounts
before the sale takes place, after which the closing entries are as
shown above.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Relation between the Corporation and Its Owners.</b>—It should
be noted that the owners of a corporation are on a somewhat different
basis in their relationships and activities to the business than are
the owners of a partnership or single proprietorship business. The
legal theory that the corporation is an entity, a person, separate
and apart from its owners, necessitates a change in the status of
accounts with owners as compared with similar accounts in the other
types of organization. A charge against a stockholder as a customer
of the corporation is on the same basis as a charge against any other
customer. A stockholder may become a creditor of the corporation in
exactly the same way as any other person. In a partnership, on the
other hand, charges against a partner and credits to his account are
looked upon as charges against and credits to his proprietary interest
in the event of liquidation of the firm. This is not true in the case
of a corporation, stockholders in such dealings being considered
“outside” parties.</p>

<p><b>Current Record on Corporation Books.</b>—After the corporation has
been organized and the opening entries made on its books, the record
of current transactions proceeds on practically the same basis as
in all other types of business organization. Sales, purchases, cash
receipts and disbursements, notes receivable and payable, and all the
transactions arising out of them, are recorded currently in the same
types of books and in the same manner as the similar transactions of
a single proprietorship or a partnership.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>While the record of current transactions is practically the same for
all types of business organizations, there are some kinds of current
transactions of a corporation which differ somewhat from those of the
other types. They arise out of the nature of the corporation and are
recorded under account titles peculiar to the corporate form. Some
of these transactions and other accounting records will be discussed
briefly.</p>

<p><b>Treasury Stock.</b>—In some classes of enterprise and also under
some methods of organizing and financing the corporation, no provision
is made for the securing of a fund of working capital, all of the
original capital being tied up in fixed assets—as a mine or some
other plant. A similar condition is sometimes encountered even after a
corporation has been operating for a number of years. Lack of business
judgment and financial foresight sometimes brings about a condition
in which the company has allowed an undue proportion of its current
assets, and therefore its working capital, to become tied up in plant
extensions.</p>

<p>In both such cases a frequent method of raising working capital is
for the stockholders to donate to the corporation a pro rata portion
of their holdings of stock to enable it to secure the needed working
capital by selling the stock. When such stock comes back into the
company’s treasury, it is termed “treasury stock.” Having once been
issued and presumably fully paid for, it has this characteristic which
does not attach to the original shares before their issue, viz., that
it can be sold at a discount without the purchasers being liable to
creditors, in case of bankruptcy, for the amount of the discount.
Par-value stock which is originally sold at a discount or which is
being sold on the instalment plan and has not therefore been paid
for in full is subject to levy for the unpaid amount in the event of
bankruptcy of the corporation. Thus, the man who buys a $100 share of
original stock for $90, is subject to a $10 levy in the event that the
assets of the corporation are not sufficient to pay its debts.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in financing highly speculative ventures such as mining,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
oil, and other similar companies, it is customary to issue the entire
capital stock of the company to the owner or owners of the mining
or oil property taken over by the corporation as the basis for its
operations. Inasmuch as the value of the properties taken over is not
determinable, it is usually impossible to show that the stock issued
for them does not represent their true value. Accordingly, such stock
is legally fully paid stock and not subject to the liability for
additional assessment which attaches to stock sold at a discount.
Working capital is provided through the donation of a portion of the
capital stock to the treasury of the corporation, which is then in a
position to sell to others the stock now fully paid and non-assessable.
It is easier to find purchasers for this stock because it can be sold
at whatever discount is necessary to dispose of it and carries with it
no liability for future assessment.</p>

<p>Treasury stock may arise also through repurchase by the company. It
may sometimes be desirable for a company to buy back some of its own
stock. This is not allowed in all states but where allowed such stock
repurchased becomes treasury stock.</p>

<p>The student should distinguish carefully between treasury stock and
unissued stock.</p>

<p><b>Accounting for Treasury Stock.</b>—The record of treasury stock
transactions is not complicated. They are discussed under three heads
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">1. Record at Time of Acquisition.</span> Only
the acquisition through donation will be explained here. Acquisition
through purchase usually involves an adjustment of purchase price to
par value and the vexed problem of valuation. This problem will be
found discussed on page 18, Volume II.</p>

<p>Assume that a company has issued all its capital stock, $1,000,000
in amount, for the acquisition of a mining property, and that the
shareholders donate to the treasury $400,000 of the stock to provide
working capital. This stock donation will be recorded on the books as
follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">Like any other gift, this gift of stock in
theory creates additional capital and must therefore be recorded in a
proprietorship account. The title “Donated Surplus” is used to indicate
the source of this additional capital. Capital arising from this source
should never be recorded in the general Surplus account, largely
because of its problematical value but also because of the information
which it gives concerning the financing of the company by making a
separate record.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2. Record at Time of Sale.</span> Assume that
$250,000 of the treasury stock is sold at 50. Inasmuch as the stock
was brought on the books at par, the portion sold must be taken off
at the same figure. The 50% discount, instead of being recorded in a
Capital Stock Discount account, will be recorded as a charge against
the Donated Surplus, thus adjusting a portion of this donated surplus,
recorded originally at par value, to its realizable value. The
following entry records the sale and adjustment:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Cash</td>

<p>The student should understand that the customary procedure of opening
the subscription books, making the entries with subscribers for
treasury stock subscriptions, payment in cash or by instalments, and
finally, the issue of the stock, may be the procedure followed in the
sale of treasury stock just as in the sale of other stock. The net
result will, however, be as shown by the above entry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">3. Record of Treasury Stock on the Balance

same way as unissued stock, namely, as a deduction item in the net

<p><b>Bonds Payable.</b>—Generally, when a corporation borrows money
on long-term notes secured by a portion of its fixed assets, chiefly
its holdings of real estate, the notes (usually of uniform amounts
so as to make them more marketable) are called “bonds.” Thus, such
notes or bonds are frequently in $100, $500, and $1,000 denominations,
making it possible for one of limited means to take advantage of the
mortgage offered as security for the loan. Bond issues are floated
in pretty much the same way as capital stock issues, being offered
for subscription at a price depending both on the interest rate which
the bonds bear and the prevailing interest rate at the time of their
offering. Thus, if the bonds bear 5% interest and the market rate for
bonds of the same general character is 6%, an investor will naturally
not be willing to pay par for them and the company will therefore have
to sell them at such a discount as will put the yield to the investor
approximately on a 6% basis. The company, by receiving for its bonds an
amount less than par value but by being required to pay interest on the
par amount, is thus paying higher than the nominal or agreed rate.</p>

<p>There is thus a very definite relationship between the bond discount
and the interest rate which the bonds bear.</p>

<p>The accounting record of bond transactions is very similar to that of
other liability transactions, and is shown under three heads as follows:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Sale of Bonds Payable.</span> Assume that a
$100,000 issue of bonds bearing 5% interest, payable semiannually, and
maturing in 20 years, is sold at 90. The record will be:

<p class="no-indent">Bonds payable are always set up at par, since that

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Bond Interest Payment.</span> At the close
of the first six months, 2½% interest, or $2,500, will be paid to the
holders of the bonds. Since the corporation will have to redeem its
bonds at par, it has been deprived of the use of $10,000, represented
by bond discount, because the issue was brought out at 5%. The $10,000
discount is therefore in the nature of a lump sum interest cost
incurred in advance—prepaid—and must be spread equitably over the
life of the bonds. Accordingly, at each of the 40 interest payments
during the life of the issue, a pro rata share of this prepaid interest
should be taken into account as bond interest. The distribution of
bond discount over the interest payments made during the life of a
bond issue is termed “amortization” of the discount. Scientifically,
amortization is worked out on a compound interest basis, discussion and
explanation of which are found on page 269, Volume II. Here, all we are
concerned with is the principle involved and for the sake of simplicity
the amortization is prorated evenly over the 40 interest periods,
resulting in an additional interest charge of $250 each period. The
record is therefore:</p>

<p><b>Bond Premium.</b>—Bonds are also often sold at a premium. As with
discount, the premium is intimately related to the interest rate which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
the bonds bear. At the time of the sale of bonds, the premium is
brought on the books as a credit, which together with the par value
at which the bonds are booked, offsets the cash received from their
sale. At the regular interest periods the premium is amortized over the
life of the bonds and so results in a lessening of the periodic bond
interest charge. The student should set up the entries to record the
sale of bonds at a premium and the interest payment for such bonds.</p>

<p><b>Sinking Fund.</b>—The sinking fund is a fund of liquid assets
created by periodic sums, usually of equal amounts, set aside during
the life of a bond issue or other liability to provide ready funds
for the cancellation of the liability at maturity. This method is
very commonly followed in public finance and is not infrequent in
private corporations. It is not purposed here to explain the methods
of determining what periodic sum is necessary to be set aside so that
these principal sums and their interest accumulations will provide
sufficient funds for the cancellation of the liability at maturity.
Nor will the complicated problem of sinking fund investments in the
hands of a trustee, and the expense and income arising out of it, be
discussed here. These and related problems are covered fully in Chapter
XXV, Volume II. Only the creation of the fund and its final disposition
are treated here, under two heads as follows:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Creation of the Fund.</span> Assume that
$1,000 cash is set aside at the end of each six months to provide for
the retirement of the bonds at maturity. The entry for this, every six
months, will be:</p>

The student will understand that the cash set aside periodically for
the sinking fund will be invested in securities in order to accumulate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
an income, which usually accrues to the fund. The securities in the
fund must be sold just before the maturity of the bond issue, in
order to provide cash. It will be assumed that in this instance the
securities in the fund have been sold, that the cash in the sinking
fund at the time of maturity is $101,500, and that the bond issue to be
retired is $100,000. The entries will be:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Entry (b) returns to the general cash the unused
cash in the sinking fund. In case of a deficiency in the sinking fund
it will be necessary, of course, to draw on the general cash for the
amount of the deficiency.</p>

<p><b>Sinking Fund Reserve.</b>—It is often the policy of a corporation,
which has to provide for the redemption of a bond issue, to reserve
from the yearly profits a sum equal to the periodic payment into the
sinking fund and the accumulations of the fund during that period.
Such a policy prevents the distribution by dividends of all the
current profits to stockholders, and insures that the increase in the
assets represented by these profits will be held in the business and
so provide each period an increased amount of assets for use in the
business and ultimately, by conversion of the assets into cash, for the
use of the sinking fund. The entries crediting the sinking fund reserve
and showing its disposition at the maturity of the bonds are as follows:</p>

<p>The first entry shows the periodic reservation of profits. The second
entry transfers the total profits so reserved during the life of the
bonds, back to surplus—capital surplus if it is desired that these
profits be made a part of the permanent capital of the corporation,
or to general surplus in the event that these profits are to be made
available for future dividends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span></p>

<p><b>Closing the Books of the Corporation.</b>—The results of the
period’s operations are summarized and the books closed in very much
the same way as with the partnership. From what has been said above,
it will be understood that there are some types of transactions to be
considered at the time of closing the corporation’s books that are
not found in the partnership and single proprietorship. These concern
largely the bond interest, the sinking fund reserve, and the dividend
transactions. Bond interest is an expense. The sinking fund reserve
is a reserve of net profits. Two methods are employed in showing the
appropriation of net profits. Under the one method the total net profit
is transferred to Surplus account, which then shows not only the profit
for the current year but also the undistributed balance of previous
years. The current appropriations of profits for whatever purpose are
then booked as a charge against Surplus. Under the other method the
current appropriations of profits are shown as charges against the
net balance in the Profit and Loss account. Any unappropriated profit
remaining is then transferred to the Surplus account.</p>

<p><b>Dividends.</b>—A business is being operated always for the
benefit of its owners, to whom the profits belong. In the case of a
corporation, before the owners may secure any of the profits, a formal
declaration of dividends must be made by the board of directors.
During the term of its election the board is supreme in its management
of the business. It is intimately in touch with the condition of the
business. It knows the needs of the corporation and its obligations and
must provide for them. If, after considering all the circumstances, it
decides that some or all of the profits should be divided among the
shareholders rather than be retained in the business for purposes of
expansion, it meets in regular session and passes a formal dividend
resolution.</p>

<p><b>Ultimate Control of Stockholders.</b>—Thus it is seen that the
board of directors is supreme during the period of its incumbency. Its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
actions are, however, subject to the review of the stockholders at
their periodic meetings, which are usually held annually. If their
policies are not favored by the shareholders, a new board, presumably
one which will carry out the will of the majority of stockholders, is
elected.</p>

<p><b>Dividends Out of Profits Only.</b>—It is forbidden by law to pay
dividends out of the capital of the corporation. Such payments would
encroach upon the net assets of the organization and thereby weaken
the creditors’ security for the payment of their claims. Dividends
need not be paid out of the profits of the current year, provided the
undistributed profits of former periods are still available.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Profits.</b>—The appropriation of profits in a
corporation differs, therefore, from that in a partnership. The entries
recording the appropriation of profits cover in the main two kinds: (1)
reserves, and (2) dividends. These entries are not necessarily the same
for all corporations nor for all periods. No set disposition of profits
is prescribed, authority resting with the directors. Their decision,
therefore, as recorded in the minutes of their meetings is the basis
for this group of entries. Some of the usual entries are illustrated in
the following paragraphs.</p>

<p><b>Reserves and Dividends.</b>—As stated above, the two methods
for handling the appropriation of profits are: (1) as a charge
against Surplus after the net profit for the current period has been
transferred to that account; and (2) as a charge against the current
Profit and Loss credit balance and a transfer of the remaining balance,
if any, to the Surplus account.</p>

<p>A part of the profits may be retained in the business to provide funds
for certain future needs, as for the payment of fixed debts, the
extension of fixed plant, etc. Such items are transferred to the credit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
of properly named reserve accounts. Profits for distribution as
dividends are similarly transferred to a Dividends Payable account. The
dividend is always based on the amount of outstanding stock, not on the
unissued or treasury stock. It is reckoned either as a percentage of
the par value of each share, as a 6% dividend, or as a stated amount on
each share, as a dividend of $4 or 10 cents per share.</p>

<p>The following illustration will show the necessary entries in
accordance with the two methods.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> Assume that the net
profits of Jackson &amp; Co. are $25,000. The directors declare an 8%
dividend on the outstanding capital stock of $100,000, and order $5,000
to be transferred to a reserve for buildings and $7,000 to a reserve
for the cancellation of a bond issue.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Dividend Liability.</b>—The student should note that the effect of
a dividend declaration is to change a portion of the proprietorship
into a liability. Surplus is decreased and liabilities are increased.
The liability so created ranks with other liabilities, i.e., the assets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
of the corporation may be used to pay the liability to its stockholders
equally with the payment of liabilities to outside creditors. The
payment of such dividend is recorded by the cancellation of the
dividend liability, as follows:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Dividends Payable<span class="ws3"> </span></td>

</table>

<p>Where there is more than one class of stock outstanding, it is
customary to keep separate dividend accounts with each class.</p>

<p><b>Other Methods of Adjusting and Closing the Books.</b>—It seems
desirable at this point, although the material is applicable to any
type of business organization, to discuss other methods of adjusting
and closing the books than those heretofore explained. In <a href="#Page_237">Chapter XXVIII</a>
and previous chapters, the methods of handling deferred expense
and income, and of summarizing the merchandising transactions were
shown. The method given there of adjusting the ledger because of
deferred expenses rested upon a classification of the various expense
accounts to be adjusted as temporary proprietorship accounts. The
method of adjustment effected a transfer out of the current part of the
account, the asset portion of the expense, and carried it over into the
next period. The balance remaining in the account after this adjustment
shows the expense, that is, the amount of service or use, chargeable to
the current period.</p>

<p>Another method of handling such items is based on an asset
classification of the accounts recording them. Under this hypothesis
such account titles as Postage, Stationery, Wrapping Supplies, and
even Insurance (that is, unexpired insurance), are classed as asset
accounts. At the close of the period when the adjustments are made, it
is necessary to transfer from such asset accounts only the portions
used or consumed during the current period. The balances left in the
accounts represent the unused assets carried over into the next period.
The difference between the two methods is indicated by the two sets of
adjusting and closing entries given below.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> Assume that $1,000 of

<p><b>The Trading or Selling Account.</b>—For the purpose of summarizing
the merchandising activities a separate account called Trading
or Merchandise Trading is sometimes used to effect the partial
summarization heretofore explained as being made in the Purchases and
Sales accounts respectively. Where so used the Trading account becomes
virtually the old Merchandise account with totals in place of details.
The following entries will show its content and the method of handling it.</p>

<p>The Trading account is thus used as a means of separating the net sales
into its two elements: (1) income, or gross profits; and (2) decrease
of assets, or the cost of goods sold. This method makes the Profit and
Loss account a purely summary account of income and expenses. Its chief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
disadvantage, however, is that a picture of the entire operations
for the period is not presented in one account. One seldom finds the
Trading account used in actual practice. It does serve, however, as an
efficient teaching device to bring out clearly the way in which the
merchandise accounts are adjusted and summarized in order to effect a
separation of the income and decrease in asset elements.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">HANDLING THE CASH</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>General Considerations.</b>—In keeping record of the various
properties of a concern, the greatest care is usually exercised in
accounting for the asset cash. This is done because of the difficulty
in tracing money that is lost or stolen and the ease with which the
thief may get rid of it, due to its universal use as a medium of
exchange, and due also to its great value in comparison with its
small bulk. Merchandise, supplies, and the like, may be purloined or
misappropriated, but not so easily and profitably. Oftentimes, however,
unless care is exercised in safe-keeping it, large losses occur also
in merchandise. Absolute prevention of losses cannot be expected
even with the employment of all possible precautions, but experience
shows that certain general safeguards may be placed about both cash
and merchandise. In the ultimate analysis the best safeguard is the
integrity of the employee; still the employer should not tempt the
employee by making the abstraction of his cash an easy performance.</p>

<p><b>Principle of the Double Record.</b>—A fundamental principle in
the handling of cash is to secure a double—not a duplicate—record
of its receipt and disbursement. The practice of depositing in a
bank all cash receipts and making disbursements only by check should
be followed invariably, because it secures this double record—the
bank’s record and the cashier’s record. Any discrepancy is detected
whenever comparison of the two records is made. When the bank’s record
is compared with the cash book record, the balances shown by each are
seldom in agreement, chiefly because of the outstanding checks which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
have not yet been presented to the bank for payment. This requires
a reconciliation of the two balances before proof of correctness is
secured, which is usually accomplished by subtracting from the bank
balance the amount of the outstanding checks. Other adjustments are
sometimes necessary. These are explained and a form of reconciliation
statement is shown on <a href="#Page_475">page 475</a>.</p>

<p>Most concerns object, however, to issuing checks for small amounts,
and set therefore a minimum below which they do not issue them. For
the purpose of paying smaller amounts, a petty cash fund is provided
from which disbursements are made in cash. This fund is established, in
the first instance, by a check on the general cash and is from time to
time replenished in the same way. In this manner the double record is
maintained.</p>

<p><b>Handling the Petty Cash.</b>—There are two general methods of
handling the petty cash. Under the one, entry of the check creating
the fund is made as an immediate charge to some expense account and no
further accounting is required. This method is based on the theory that
the cash is to be used for petty expenses anyway, and might as well be
so charged now as later. Subsequent amounts for replenishment of the
petty cash are treated in the same way. The objection to this method,
from the accounting viewpoint, is that it results in an inaccurate
record of expense distribution and a misstatement of the facts in that
it charges to expense an item which at the time of the charge is still
a part of the general cash fund. The second and chief objection is
that it encourages in the petty cashier loose methods in handling and
accounting for the fund, as usually no strict reckoning is required.</p>

<p>The second method, known as the “imprest method,” is in more general
favor. This charges the original check creating the fund to an
account called “Petty Cash.” The petty cashier is required to secure
a receipted bill, sales ticket, or other voucher for every petty cash
item of expenditure, so that at all times the amount of cash in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
possession added to the receipted bills and vouchers must equal the
original amount in the fund. Usually the fund is a fixed amount,
its size depending upon the needs of the business for these small
expenditures. When the cash in the fund becomes low, the petty cashier
turns over his receipted bills to the general cashier, who issues a
check for their exact total to replenish the petty cash by the amount
of its depletion, thus restoring it to its original fixed amount.</p>

<p>The expenditures as shown by the receipted bills and vouchers are
classified and entered by either of the following two methods: (1)
as a charge to the several accounts through the general cash book,
offsetting the petty cash replenishing check; in this case no charge
appears in the “Petty Cash” account except the item covering the
original check; or (2) by an entry through the journal debiting the
various expenses and other items and crediting Petty Cash. This latter
method necessitates charging in the general cash book the replenishing
check to Petty Cash as an offset to the journal credit of the same
amount. Most accountants consider the postings to the Petty Cash
unnecessary—except the original—and so check both in cash book
and journal. If, however, posting to the Petty Cash account in the
general ledger is made whenever the fund is replenished, this will
serve to indicate the activity of the fund on the face of the ledger
account—information which could just as easily be obtained from the
petty cash book. The imprest method thus effects a careful accounting
of the petty expenditures.</p>

<p><b>The Petty Cash Book.</b>—The petty cash book is usually a columnar
record with the amount columns to the right of the explanation space.
The first column is the receipts column, the second the disbursements
column, and the others show under appropriate titles the distribution
of disbursements. One form of the book is shown in <a href="#FORM_39">Form 39</a>,
with typical entries and balancing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_39" src="images/i_369.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365" />
  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 39. Petty Cash Book</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
Sometimes the classified summary which is made the basis of the general
cash book or journal entry referred to above, is shown in the petty
cash book, the account titles being written in the explanation column,
with the amounts opposite in the credit column underneath the $100
total. The items of this summary are then posted to the ledger, and
the debit of the replenishing check to Petty Cash on the general cash
book is “checked” in the ledger folio column. Or if the distributive
column titles give sufficiently analyzed account titles, their totals
may be posted without formal summarization, posting being shown by
the small-figure ledger page in each column, <a href="#FORM_39">as in the
illustration</a>. Where the petty cash book is used as a posting medium, of course
no summarization of it is made either in the journal or the general cash book.</p>

<p><b>Keeping the Bank Account.</b>—Several different methods of keeping
the bank account are in use. Sometimes the check stub is the only
record kept; in <a href="#Page_192">Chapter XXIII</a> reference was
made to the two methods of keeping the account for the entry of
deposits—either on the face or the back of the stub. When the entry is
made on the face, each check is usually subtracted from the previous
balance and the new balance is shown. When deposits are recorded on the
back of the stub—or on a special deposit interleaf—check totals and
deposit totals may be carried forward from leaf to leaf without showing
any balance.</p>

<p>A better method is to use the stub only as a memo from which to make
formal entry in the cash book columns—one for deposits on the debit
side and one for checks on the credit side. These bank columns may be
used, first, for the purpose of keeping the bank account, by showing
the totals of deposits—but not the items composing each deposit—and
the totals of the checks that have been drawn; and second, for the
purpose of furnishing weekly or monthly totals for posting to a ledger
account kept with the bank, thus making the ledger self-balancing
without having to bring in the cash book balance.</p>

<p>If, however, the principle of double record (explained earlier in
the chapter) is followed, there is no need of a <i>special</i> bank
deposits column, since the total of the Net Cash column gives the amount
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
of each day’s deposits, and similarly the Net Cash column on the credit
side shows the checks drawn against the bank. Thus the policy of
depositing in the bank all receipts and disbursing only by check has
an added advantage in that it simplifies the keeping of the record of
cash as well as proving it. Under this method, the cash journals may be
summarized, just as the other journals, and posted to a Cash account
in the ledger. Detailed instructions for the handling of the entries,
balancing, and closing under this method are given in <a href="#Page_272">Chapter XXXI</a>.</p>

<p>Another and rather unusual method of keeping the cash book is to carry
a Currency column on each side, supplemented by Bank columns for
deposits and checks on the debit and credit sides respectively. In the
debit Currency column are entered all receipts of money in regular
course. When the bank deposit is made up, its amount is entered as a
charge to the bank in the credit Currency column and also, as a memo,
in the debit Bank column. As checks are drawn they are entered in the
credit Bank column. Thus the balance of the Currency columns should
show the actual amount of cash in the cash drawer at any time, and the
difference between the Bank columns should show the balance in the
bank. Though somewhat complicated, the method has its advantages under
conditions where currency accumulates before being deposited in the
bank.</p>

<p>Of course, under all methods of keeping the cash record, the
requirement that all cash received be deposited and payment be made
only by check should be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p><b>Entering Checks on the Cash Book.</b>—When all disbursements are
by check, every check drawn must be entered on the cash book and
accounted for. Entry should be made in numerical sequence with suitable
explanation of any spoiled checks. The amount of the spoiled check
may be left blank or entered as usual, but in the latter case the
spoiled check must also be included in the day’s deposits, and the
bank’s cancellation stamp must be secured. Neither the deposit nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
disbursement is posted, each entry being marked “contra” by way of
explanation. This effects an inflation of the total receipts and
disbursements, but inasmuch as the bank’s record also shows the
inflation, an adequate safeguard is secured. The new check replacing
the one spoiled is entered in regular order.</p>

<p>The method just discussed is perhaps the best way of recording the
exchange of checks for cash. Sometimes a concern is asked to exchange
its check for currency, the party making the request desiring to send
the check through the mails or for some other purpose. The entry is
best made on both the debit and the credit side of the cash book with
reference “contra” in each case, but neither entry need be posted. This
makes the cash book record check against the bank record and shows the
full history of the transaction. When a check is cashed in currency, or
when a check of larger amount is received in payment of a debt and the
difference is returned in cash, no record need be made of the check, as
only the nature—not the amount—of the deposit for the day is changed
and no disbursement is made which affects the bank account. When,
however, a check is issued for “change” in lieu of currency, record
should be made, debit and credit, as shown above.</p>

<p><b>Branch Cash—The Working Fund.</b>—Frequently cash working funds
must be provided for the current expenses of branches or of a factory
located at a distance from the main office. When the branch or factory
keeps a separate set of books, it must be charged with the advances of
the working fund and a careful audit of the way the fund is handled must
be made periodically, just as would be done with an independent concern.</p>

<p>Such cash transfers may also be handled by the imprest method as
explained above. The original advance is charged to “Factory” or
“Branch Cash,” and is deposited in the branch’s local bank to the
credit of the head office, the branch having the privilege of using
it. The branch may draw checks against the fund, sending the canceled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
checks to the head office as supporting vouchers for its disbursements.
These canceled checks become the basis for the replenishing checks and
also for the charges for branch expenditures made on the head office books.</p>

<p>If the branch is a selling agency making sales for cash and on account,
a modification of the system is necessary. Daily reports should be
required from the branch. Its cash receipts should be deposited daily
and a duplicate deposit ticket should be forwarded to the head office
by the bank. The bank should be asked also to forward all canceled
checks. All collections on customers’ accounts should be made from
the head office. This does not prevent the abstraction of cash before
deposit, but it at least places control or oversight of the bank
cash account in the hands of the head office and secures a careful
accounting of it.</p>

<p><b>Safeguarding Cash—General Principles.</b>—Proper safeguards
for the cash should always be provided. The method of the double
record—the bank’s and the owner’s cash book—is good so far as it
goes and acts as a check on cash transactions <i>after</i> the record
is made, but does not insure that the cash book record will be made
correctly in the first place. There are ways in which cash received may
get into the cashier’s or salesmen’s pockets instead of the cash book.
No system or method has yet been devised to prevent this entirely.
Every system must rest at some point upon the integrity of the human
agent, and will fail of its full efficiency and intended results if
the agent fails in the trust reposed in him. Every effort should be
made to prevent both petty thievery—the abstraction of small sums at
every opportunity—and systematic robbery mapped out and planned with
infinite care and detail. Only everlasting vigilance and a system of
“checks” will secure satisfactory results, as occasionally it is the
<i>trusted</i> employee who is not true to the trust placed in him.</p>

<p><b>Internal Check.</b>—By internal check is meant the method by which
employees check each other’s records, control not resting entirely in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
any one clerk. Thus a system of record-making which combines the work
of the cashier and bookkeeper under one clerk or which gives the
cashier access to the ledgers is one which invites dishonesty.</p>

<p>Where the cashier has entire control of the cash, and besides opens the
incoming mail, makes up his daily deposits, has his pass-books balanced
periodically, and files the canceled checks, he has every opportunity
to abstract cash and falsify his records. But where he must make
detailed daily reports of the cash to the manager, treasurer, or some
other officer; where he is denied access to the records—except his own
cash record—and where his record is subject to periodic proof; where
the mail is opened first and receipts listed by an independent clerk;
where a careful system of proving receipts from cash sales and of
allowing no unauthorized deliveries over the counter is employed; where
every member of the office force is required to take a vacation during
which his work and records are cared for by other employees—there is a
very satisfactory system of internal safeguards and checks.</p>

<p>All these devices and systems are applicable in full only in large
concerns where minute division of duties is possible. In smaller
concerns where many duties have to be combined under one person, the
problem of safeguarding the cash and providing other measures to
prevent fraud of various sorts is more difficult. In such a concern,
at least the cash received through the mail should be listed first by
someone other than the cashier or bookkeeper, and the daily deposit
slip should be compared with this list to see that all the cash items
are included. The cash received from cash sales should also be proved
daily against the sales tickets.</p>

<p><b>Statement of Receipts and Disbursements.</b>—A periodic report
of cash is usually made by means of a statement of receipts and
disbursements. This statement is an abstract or summary of the cash
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
book, showing the total receipts from various sources and the causes of
the disbursements and their totals. A simple form is given below:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_40" src="images/i_375.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="472" />
  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 40. Weekly Statement of Receipts<br />
                               and Disbursements</p>
</div>

<p>To assist in checking past deposits, an itemized record of daily
cash receipts is often kept, analyzed as to gold, silver, currency,
notes and checks. To be of value this record should be filed with the
daily deposit tickets and should be later available for purposes of
comparison.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">NOTES RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Conditions Precedent to the Present Use of Notes and
Bills.</b>—During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there was much
bad money in circulation in Europe because of the widespread practice
of coin-shaving and the entire lack of standards of purity of the
coins. If a monarch needed funds for war or government purposes, his
easiest way of getting them was to increase the amount of base alloy
in the coins of the country or to increase the rate of seigniorage. As
the former method might be resorted to several times during the reign
of one sovereign, the weight and relative purity of metallic coins had
no relation to the denominated value of the coins, and they fell under
general suspicion. Consequently, only the money dealers, who could
determine the actual value of coins by assaying them, were willing to
trade for coins. These men gradually became the custodians of moneys
for merchants, who were given receipts showing the assay value of the
coins deposited. Because the receipt represented tested and proven value,
it was a more acceptable medium of exchange than the coins themselves.</p>

<p>Medieval trade was subject to many perils, chief of which was that from
robbers. Any safeguards placed about the transportation of money from
one place to another, or any method devised for settling debts without
the transportation of coin and bullion, were more than welcome. Out of
these conditions arose the method of settling debts by means of drafts.
The draft, not countenanced by law at first, had standing, however,
under the “law merchant,” the code of rules recognized by merchants as
governing commercial relations. This code was later incorporated by
statute into the law of the country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span></p>

<p>These two kinds of paper, the one a receipt for coin which was in the
nature of a demand promise to pay, the other a counterpart of the
modern draft, were the forerunners of our promissory notes and bills of
exchange of the present day. The law with regard to the bill or draft
became settled as the result of the practice of merchants sooner than
that relating to notes.</p>

<p><b>The Titles “Notes” and “Bills.”</b>—In this way, the word “bill”
became an established term. The titles “bills receivable” and “bills
payable” still cling to both classes of items. Inasmuch as the accepted
bill is practically identical with the promissory note, and the title
“bill” is so often used interchangeably with the word “invoice,” it
is advisable to use the terms <i>notes receivable</i> and <i>notes
payable</i> instead of bills receivable and bills payable. Some
advocate the use of the title “acceptances” in order to distinguish
accepted bills from promissory notes. Unless these two classes of paper
are large enough in volume to justify it, little advantage is secured
by this separation of their bookkeeping record. However, in the case of
trade acceptances, i.e., acceptances based on particular sales of goods
and therefore evidencing bona fide commercial transactions as the basis
for the extension of credit, it is advisable, because of their superior
rating in the money markets, to segregate this class of acceptances
from notes and other acceptances.</p>

<p><b>Relation of the Note to the Open Account.</b>—In the preliminary
discussion of the relation of the note to the open account in <a href="#Page_173">Chapter XXI</a>,
it was pointed out that both the note and account are claims
against the person liable for payment; and that the one is carried
under a class title “notes receivable,” because the number of such
notes is usually small, while each account receivable is carried under
a separate title which designates the person liable for payment. The
essential difference between the two kinds of claims is that the note
is an acknowledgment of the justice of the claim and the correctness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
the amount, whereas the claim under the open account may be disputed
and in case of dispute requires outside proof; besides, the open
account may always be offset by counterclaims and sometimes by a return
of all or a part of the goods bought.</p>

<p>Any defenses of value under the contract for which the note was given
are good defenses as between the original parties to a note; but not
so as between the maker and a third party who is an innocent purchaser
for value. To him the maker is liable according to the exact terms
and tenor of the note. Only so could the element of negotiability be
insured and the note pass from hand to hand as money. In no other sense
is the note a preferred claim over the open account.</p>

<p>In case of bankruptcy a claim against the bankrupt under an open
account and a claim under a promissory note or an acceptance made by
the bankrupt before his insolvency, rank alike, both sharing pro rata
in the net assets available for the satisfaction of the total claim of
unsecured creditors.</p>

<p><b>Relative Liquidity of the Note and Open Account.</b>—Compared
with the liquidity of open accounts, promissory notes have a slight
advantage in that they can more readily be turned into cash and at a
better rate. Although an assignment of open accounts is possible by
hypothecating them with a third party, the cost of such assignment is
almost prohibitive and is resorted to only where the customary sources
of credit are not available.</p>

<p>The legitimacy and the low cost of discounting notes greatly increase
their liquidity. Oftentimes the question of risk, i.e., the degree of
certainty of their payment when due, enters into the determination of
the relative liquidity as between open accounts and promissory notes,
but from this standpoint there is little, if any, difference between
the two claims. Occasionally a firm, which refuses to pay its debts
on open account, will meet its notes and acceptances in an effort to
bolster its credit at the local banks. This phase of the question does
not usually enter into the discounting operation, where the credit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
the discounter is the determining factor in raising money. Of course,
this may be only a temporary expedient if the note is dishonored and
charged back to the bank. In some lines of business it is very common
practice to secure notes for overdue accounts. If the Notes Receivable
account contains many such items, its liquidity is seriously to be
doubted. However, the note is usually classed as a more liquid asset
than the open account.</p>

<p><b>Method of Recording Notes.</b>—As to the accounting phase, a
record is made of each note received or given, entry being to Notes
Receivable or Payable, as the case may be. If the note transactions
are few in number, the general journal is used for their record. Ample
explanation must be given as to the essential facts of date, maker,
for what received, rate of interest, due date, etc. Notes receivable
must be watched carefully, as failure to present them when due releases
all indorsers. There is nothing unusual in the entry when made in the
general journal, its debit and credit being determined as indicated
in <a href="#Page_85">Chapter XI</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Note Journals.</b>—Because the general journal does not lend
itself to an easy record of the essential data pertaining to note
transactions, a separate book is oftentimes kept for this purpose. This
special book may be used merely as a memorandum record for carrying the
detailed explanation of the Journal entry; or it may become a special
journal that is used as an integral part of the accounting system, and,
when so used, posting to the ledgers is made direct therefrom. The use
of this special journal is always advisable when note transactions are
numerous. A bills or notes receivable journal may be ruled as shown on
<a href="#FORM_41">Form 41</a>. The notes payable journal differs but
slightly from the notes receivable journal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_41" src="images/i_380.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="373" />
  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 41. Notes Receivable Journal<br />
                    (left and right hand pages)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
If the bill book is for memorandum use only, the “Amounts Credited”
columns may be omitted. If it is a real note <i>journal</i>, its debit
and credit equilibrium is shown through summary entry at posting time.
The total debit is to Notes Receivable for the amount of that column’s
total. If it were not for the fact that sometimes notes are received
in whose face amount is included not only the credit to the customer
but an interest item as well, there would be no need of credit columns.
The note journal would then be operated just as is any simple special
journal, with a debit to Notes Receivable and the same amount credited
to the customer; but when interest is included, the note is best
recorded in an additional column, separating the credit to Customers
from that to Interest. If notes are numerous, a distributive column
in the cash book should be used for receipts from notes, in order to
secure a total posting to the credit of Notes Receivable account.</p>

<p>Referring to the left-hand page of the illustrated ruling
(<a href="#FORM_41">Form 41</a>), the face amount of the note
receivable is entered in the Notes Receivable column, and the due date
in one of the narrow columns headed “When Due,” each of these columns
representing a separate month. In this way it is easy to find the
total of all the notes due in a given month and the amount of cash to
be expected from their payment. For this purpose, however, it is best
to use a note journal arranged by <i>months of maturity</i> on the
principle of a “tickler.” In such a journal one page is reserved for
each month, and the notes are entered, not on the page for the month
when received, but on that for the month when due. Thus a note received
in January and due in March should be entered on the March page. To
secure a summary of all notes received during each month for posting
to Notes Receivable account at the end of each month, the various
month pages are totaled and “recapped” on a special page. On this
“recap” page, at the end of January, say, will be entered the total
of the January page, giving the notes received in and maturing during
January; the total of the February page, giving the notes received
in January but maturing in February; etc., for each month during the
year. The grand total is the amount to be posted to the general ledger,
representing all notes received during January.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span></p>

<p>This type of journal gives easy control over maturities, and forecasts
for a given month the amount of cash receipts from notes.</p>

<p><b>Notes Entered at Face Value Always.</b>—Some notes are
interest-bearing from their date of issue; others only after their due
date when not paid. Even on non-interest-bearing notes, the law allows
the charging of interest for their overdue period. From the standpoint
of strict accuracy, a note payable at a future time is not worth its
face value at the time of entry, unless it is interest-bearing from
date at approximately as high a rate as the current discount rate.
Its present value is such an amount as when placed on interest will
equal the face at its due date. That value increases day by day until
it reaches par or face on the due date. Because of the practical
difficulties encountered in the numerous adjustments necessary under
any other method of entry, universal practice countenances the bringing
of the note onto the books at a slightly inflated value, i.e., face
value, at the time of entry. Face value is the amount of the credit
to the customer’s account; it shows the amount to be collected on
account of the note; and if interest-bearing, the amount on which the
interest is based. Accordingly, the note transaction is entered at its
face value. Where the note is interest-bearing and the face plus the
interest is paid at maturity, credit is in two items, one to Notes
Receivable for the face, and the other to Interest Income for the
amount received as interest.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the interest for the period the note is to run is
added to the amount of the debt, and the sum is made the face of a
non-interest-bearing note. The purpose of such procedure is to secure
a compounding of interest for the first period if the note is not paid
at maturity. The entry of the note on the books is a debit to Notes
Receivable for its face, and credits to the customer for the amount of
the debt and to Interest Income for the amount of the interest. Only a
credit to Notes Receivable is made when the note is paid. The credit to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
Interest Income, before the interest is actually earned and received,
is necessitated by its pre-estimate and inclusion in the face of the
note. Were a balance sheet drawn up on that date, the entire amount of
this interest would be shown as deferred income.</p>

<p><b>The Interest Accounts.</b>—As explained in <a href="#Page_115">Chapter XV</a>,
when interest items are numerous two interest accounts are usually carried
on the ledger, one for Interest Income and one for Interest Cost.
Sometimes, however, only the one account, Interest and Discount,
is carried, and if it is desirable to separate the two classes of
interest, it may be done by entering the debit and credit totals of the
Interest and Discount account—instead of simply the balance—when the
trial balance is taken. Needless to say, bank discount—interest paid
in advance—is the only kind of discount recorded under this account
title; it must not be confused with discounts on sales and purchases,
which receive different accounting treatment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN RECORDING<br />
NOTES RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Entries in the Account.</b>—The elementary discussion of entries to
the note accounts in <a href="#Page_106">Chapter XIV</a> will be reviewed
and amplified here.</p>

<p>Where the Notes Receivable account in the ledger shows each note
separately rather than the totals of the items, good practice
countenances the recording of the <i>credits</i> in this account in
non-chronologic order. Thus, when a customer settles his promissory
note and the document is returned to him, the credit to Notes
Receivable should be entered directly opposite the original debit item.
This brings each complete note transaction on a single line and shows
at a glance which notes are outstanding, as evidenced by the blank
lines on the credit side of the account.</p>

<p>When, however, the credit items are entered in chronological order,
the same purpose may be accomplished by the use of an index figure for
the original debit and the corresponding credit item.</p>

<p>What has been said above applies equally to notes payable.</p>

<p><b>The Discounted Note.</b>—In the booking of notes receivable
discounted and accepted drafts, a problem arises because of the legal
right accorded the holders of notes, in case of non-payment by the
maker, to look for payment to any or all of the indorsers, provided
certain formal requirements are complied with. Whenever a business
house transfers a note by any method of indorsement (except the
qualified), it incurs a <i>contingent liability</i>, which may become
a <i>real liability</i> if the maker of the note fails to meet the
obligation at maturity. Since it is the function of good accounting to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
present <i>all</i> the financial facts bearing on the business, it is
evident that whenever a contingent liability is incurred, it should
be entered in the books of account. Very frequently, however, this
liability is ignored, with the result that it is eventually lost sight
of altogether.</p>

<p>The usual, though incorrect, method of journalizing a note discounted
transaction is as follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Cash</li>
<li class="isub2">Interest Cost</li>
<li class="isub5">Notes Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">Usually when an asset is sold, a credit to the
account of the asset sold is correct, but not so in the case of notes
sold, i.e., of notes discounted. For the purpose of showing the
complete facts, the entry at the time of discount should be made as
follows:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Cash</li>
<li class="isub2">Interest Cost</li>
<li class="isub5">Notes Receivable Discounted</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">and at maturity when the note is paid by the maker:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">Notes Receivable Discounted</li>
<li class="isub5">Notes Receivable</li>
</ul>

<p>The effect of the first entry is to set up a suspense account, Notes
Receivable Discounted, representing the contingent liability on the
discounted note. The effect of the second entry is, first, to cancel
the <i>credit</i> of the Notes Receivable Discounted account, because
upon payment of the note by the maker the contingent liability ceases;
and second, to cancel the original <i>debit</i> to the Notes Receivable
account which was made at the time the promissory note was received but
which remained <i>unchanged</i> when the note was discounted, because
it was still needed to record the contingent asset which would become a
real asset in case the contingent liability became a real liability.</p>

<p>It has been argued that the above treatment of discounted notes
stretches the theory of debit and credit nearly to the breaking point.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
It must be observed, however, that unless accounting records are so
kept as to give the necessary information, they are not serving the
purpose which justifies their existence. Any theory which prevents the
proper functioning of the records must be changed; there is no place
for it.</p>

<p>It would be incorrect, however, to regard Notes Receivable Discounted
as an independent liability account, because it only represents a
contingent liability. The two accounts, Notes Receivable and Notes
Receivable Discounted, must be considered together, the latter account
being set up merely for the purpose of keeping notes discounted under
review until their final status is determined. The purpose of the
Notes Receivable Discounted account is in a way similar to that of the
valuation accounts of depreciating assets. The asset account is held
at its original figure, and in order to determine the present value of
the asset, the valuation account must be referred to. Similarly, the
asset account, Notes Receivable, is held at its original figure, even
though some or all of the notes are discounted, and in order to know
the amount of notes receivable actually on hand, the credit of the
Notes Discounted account must be subtracted from the debit of the Notes
Receivable account. In the balance sheet, Notes Receivable Discounted
is not shown as a liability item, but appears as a deduction from Notes
Receivable, only the difference, representing the amount of notes
actually in possession, being extended among the assets. It should be
noted, however, that this contingent liability is oftentimes shown on
the liability side of the balance sheet, the corresponding asset, Notes
Receivable, then being separated into two items, “Notes on Hand,” and
“Notes under Discount per contra.” Banks uniformly follow this practice
in showing these and similar items.</p>

<p>At maturity of the note the final entry (Notes Receivable Discounted
debit and Notes Receivable credit) is placed upon the books as
illustrated above. Usually no formal notice is received by the
indorser that the note has been paid by the maker. In case the note is
dishonored, prompt notice would be sent, and failure to receive such
notice implies that the note has been duly paid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span></p>

<p>What has been said above concerning notes applies equally to accepted
drafts, the legal character of which is identical with that of notes,
the status of the drawer of an accepted draft being the same as that
of the first indorser of a promissory note. The contingent liability
arising from the transfer of all negotiable instruments should usually
be shown.</p>

<p>In some instances, however, there may be good practical reasons for not
adhering to the above principle. When, for instance, a large number of
notes and acceptances are handled and the experience of the business
shows that few of them are ever dishonored, or if the matter is under
constant review by the financial manager, it might be considered an
unnecessary requirement to make use of a separate Notes Receivable
Discounted account. It must be left to the judgment of the accountant
to decide which method is preferable in connection with the needs
of the business. However, if no current account is kept to show the
contingent liability, at the end of the period the balance sheet must
be made to show the amount of discounted notes still outstanding as of
the closing date of the period.</p>

<p><b>The Dishonored Note.</b>—A note is dishonored either when the
maker refuses payment upon its legal presentation at maturity or when
there is sufficient evidence that he intends to refuse. When a note
is dishonored, a formal protest is required in order to hold the
indorsers. The payee appears before a notary public or some other
officer with notarial powers, and makes oath that legal presentment of
the note has been made and that the payment was refused. The notary
then takes the note and personally presents it for payment to the
maker. If payment is still refused, the notary makes a certificate of
protest and mails notices of the protest to all indorsers desired to be
held. Such notice is sufficient basis for action to recover from the
party or parties thus notified.</p>

<p>In making the accounting record of a dishonored note, a number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
problems may arise. These problems deal with these
two situations: (1) when the note is dishonored in the hands of
the named payee; and (2) when the note has been discounted by
him and is charged back on account of dishonor. To illustrate the
entries required, take the following two cases:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span> Case 1.</b> Promissory note made by P.
Canning for $100. Payee, D. Johnson. Due December 15.
At maturity Johnson presents the note for payment, but
payment is refused.</p>

<p><b>Case 2.</b> Promissory note for $250 made by P. Canning.
Payee, D. Johnson. Due December 15. Note was discounted
by Johnson. Final holder is A. Andrews who presents the
note for payment on December 15, but payment is refused.</p>

<p>The questions arising in connection with these two
cases may be stated as follows: What record should be
made on December 15—</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub5">(a) By D. Johnson in case 1.</li>
<li class="isub5">(b) By A. Andrews in case 2.</li>
<li class="isub5">(c) By D. Johnson in case 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>(a) D. Johnson, at the time he received the note from
Canning, made the following entry:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Notes Receivable<span class="ws7"> </span></td>

   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"> </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">P. Canning</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">100.00</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">and on December 15, in order to show that the
note is dishonored, he may make either of the following two entries:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">(1) P. Canning<span class="ws3"> </span></td>
      <td class="tdr">100.00</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"> </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">Notes Receivable</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">100.00</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"><big>or</big></td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">(2) Notes Receivable Dishonored<span class="ws2"> </span></td>
      <td class="tdr">100.00</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"> </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">Notes Receivable</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">100.00</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Entry (1) takes the charge out of the note account and sets it
up again as a claim on Canning’s open account. Entry (2) transfers
the charge to a Notes Receivable Dishonored account. Entry (2) is
theoretically a better entry than entry (1), because from the latter
it might be inferred that the nature of the claim has changed from
a note claim to an open account claim. Such change has not taken
place, however; Johnson’s claim against Canning is still on the note.
Therefore, entry (1) is not true to the facts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, entry (1) has an important advantage over entry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
(2), because by posting entry (1) Canning’s personal account in the
ledger is made to show the fact that one of his promissory notes was
dishonored. This is a matter of very great importance, especially if
Canning should again apply for an extension of credit.</p>

<p>If the second method is adopted, it is clear that the posting of the
entry will not show the dishonor of the note on Canning’s account. It
is essential, therefore, that the bookkeeper should make a special memo
of the fact in that account. If the bookkeeper could be depended upon
to make such memorandum entry, the desired purpose of making Canning’s
account show a complete record of all dealings with him would be
accomplished. Any treatment consistent with accounting principles and
securing a complete history in one place of all dealings with the same
individual satisfies all requirements.</p>

<p>(b) A. Andrews, who is the last indorsee of the note, should make
the following entry at the time the note is dishonored:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Notes Receivable Dishonored<span class="ws3"> </span></td>

      <td class="tdl_ws2">Notes Receivable</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr">250.00</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">The Notes Receivable Dishonored account represents
Andrews’ claim against any or all the indorsers whom he wishes to hold
responsible. Instead of this, an entry might be made corresponding to
entry (1) discussed above.</p>

<p>(c) In case the note should be charged back to Johnson, either by
Andrews or by one of the other indorsers, he should make the following
entries:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Notes Receivable Discounted<span class="ws5"> </span></td>

<p>It is to be understood that all expenses in connection with the
dishonored note should be charged either to the personal account of the
maker or to the Notes Receivable Dishonored account, as the case may be.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
Where the Notes Receivable Dishonored account is used, it secures a
good analysis of the claims against customers from the standpoint of
probable realization and gives a relatively better basis for the bad
debts estimate than that offered by the other manner of treatment. Of
course, the use of such an account is limited to the ledger; it never
appears as such on the balance sheet, being included there in the
customers’ accounts with ample reserve for uncollectible items.</p>

<p><b>The Classification of Notes.</b>—The Notes Receivable account
should carry only the short-time notes of customers, and thus be a
truly current asset. Long-time notes and those secured by mortgage
should be booked under separate account titles. For a similar reason,
the notes receivable given by officers, employees, or stockholders
of the corporation should have separate booking, as these notes are
given for the purpose of making formal record and acknowledgment of
indebtedness, usually without regard to time of payment. Such notes do
not constitute easily convertible assets, and therefore should not be
recorded under the same account with short-time customers’ notes.</p>

<p><b>Notes Receivable Out as Collateral.</b>—Notes receivable are
sometimes given as collateral security for a loan. When they are so
used, no bookkeeping problem is involved—though a memorandum to show
their use as such should appear in the note account, and in case a
balance sheet is drawn up, a cross-reference or a footnote should
indicate the liability secured by the notes. However, the sale of the
notes to satisfy the loan constitutes a regular business transaction,
which should be recorded in the proper manner.</p>

<p><b>Note Renewals and Partial Payments.</b>—The renewal of notes and
partial payments are other features met in the accounting for notes.
The renewal of a note is rather a question of business policy than of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
accounting procedure. When a note is renewed, it is usually better to
deliver up the old note and secure a new one in its stead. The accounts
should reflect the transaction by showing cancellation of the old and
receipt of the new note. If the old note is extended, a memorandum of
that fact should be entered in the ledger account.</p>

<p>From the financial standpoint, if neither note is interest-bearing, the
amount of the renewal note should be larger than that of the old note,
to cover the cost of deferring payment to a future date. For example,
if the old note amounts to $1,000 and is renewed two months later, the
amount of the new note should be fixed at $1,000 plus 1% interest, or
$1,010.</p>

<p>In accounting for partial payments, no new accounting principle is
involved. When such payments are numerous, additional space in the
note journal and in the ledger should be provided for the purpose of
facilitating the actual work of making the book record.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIV<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">DISCOUNTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Definition and Kinds.</b>—A discount is a deduction from a
listed or named figure. The manufacturer or wholesaler in making up
his catalogue for the trade usually enters his products at certain
prices—called “list prices”—which are not selling prices but only
nominal amounts on which the actual sale prices are based. For reasons
to be explained later, he offers buyers a deduction from list prices
which is called “trade discount.” The usual quotation of sale prices is
at so many per cent below the list prices.</p>

<p>Among practically all merchants it is a very common practice to bill
goods to customers with settlement allowed on an optional basis.
The goods may be billed “net,” i.e., the full amount shown in the
invoice must be paid. Since there is a relationship between the time
allowed for payment and the amount to be paid, most concerns have
an established credit term, at the end of which they expect full
settlement of the account, but, as an inducement for earlier payment,
they offer a reduction in the amount to be paid. This is stated usually
at so much per cent below the billed price, and is generally called
“cash discount.” The practice had its origin in conditions prevailing
at the close of the Civil War when business failures were numerous and
the risk on open accounts even for short credit terms was very great.</p>

<p>Bankers when making loans usually deduct from the face of the loan
the interest charge for the use of the money. This deduction is called
“bank discount.”</p>

<p>Merchants usually allow a deduction for the prepayment of a customer’s
note, and this is called “commercial discount,” to distinguish it from
bank discount, although the two kinds of discount are essentially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
identical; the only difference being that in the one case a bank buys
a merchant’s note, while in the other case it is a transaction between
two commercial houses, the one buying back its own note before it is
legally due.</p>

<p>Trade discounts are very seldom recorded on the books, the actual
selling price and not the list price being entered. Cash discounts are
invariably recorded. If the merchant knew at the time of the sale which
optional basis of settlement the buyer would choose, he could record
the transaction at a net figure on that basis without entering the
discount portion. This would, of course, result in a varying figure at
which sales were booked. Accordingly, the almost invariable practice
is to record sales at the gross amount and show by means of the Sales
Discount account the acceptance of any lesser sum in settlement in
accordance with the sales contract. Bank discount has to be booked in
order to show the cost of the loan which is the difference between the
asset received, cash, and the asset parted with, notes. The matter of
bank discount has been treated in some detail in <a href="#Page_376">Chapter XLII</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Method and Purpose of Trade Discount.</b>—Trade discounts are
so universally met with in business that an extended discussion of them
will be of value to the student. As has been stated, a trade discount
is a deduction from the list price and it serves two purposes. It is
apparent that the prices listed in the catalogue cannot be changed
until a new catalogue is printed and that it would not be practicable
to print a new catalogue to make a change in selling prices. Therefore,
instead of reprinting the catalogue whenever market prices fluctuate
and a change in the list prices must be made, sheets containing the
discounts allowed from list prices are published, the expense of which
is much less than that of a new catalogue.</p>

<p>The other purpose served by the trade discount is in partly concealing
the real quotation. Without the rate of discount allowed from that
list, the catalogue tells nothing of the real price. In this way a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
concern in publishing its catalogue does not lay itself open to the
risk of being underbid by competitors publishing later catalogues.</p>

<p>Prices may be quoted at a single discount or by means of a series of
discounts, each taking as its base the net amount left after deducting
the next preceding discount. Examples will illustrate:</p>

<div class="blockquot no-wrap">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Goods listed at $250 are quoted at 20% off.<br />
    The sale price here is $200.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Goods listed at $500 are quoted at 50% and 20% off.<br />
    50% off $500 leaves $250.<br />
    20%  ”  $250 &emsp;”&emsp;  $200—the same real sale price as in No. 1.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Goods listed at $750 are priced at 50%, 33⅓%, and 20% off.<br />
    50%   off $750 leaves $375.<br />
    33⅓% ”   $375 &emsp;”&emsp;  $250.<br />
    20%    ”   $250 &emsp;”&emsp;  $200—the same as in Nos. 1 and 2.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is apparent that the <i>list</i> prices without
the trade discounts tell nothing as to the <i>real</i> prices.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Calculation.</b>—Short methods for calculating trade
discounts when given in a series are often employed. For a series of
only two discounts, a single rate equivalent to the two may be found
by subtracting their product from their sum—always treating them as decimals.
Thus a series of 20 and 20 is equivalent to a single rate of 36,</p>

<p class="f110">(.20 + .20 = .40; .20 × .20 = .04; .40 - .04 = .36).</p>

<p>Another method of calculating trade discounts, and one applicable to
a series of any number of discounts, is to treat the discount off
as equivalent to one-minus-the-discount on. Thus a discount of 15%
is equivalent to 85% of the list. An additional discount of 10% is
equivalent to 90% of the new base, or 90% of 85% of the original list,
or 76.5%. Thus a continued multiplication of the “percentages on” gives
the single sale price multiplier to be applied to the list price. If
the single discount rate is desired, it is secured by subtracting the
multiplier from 1, or 100%. Take the series 60, 20, 10, and 10 off.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
This is equivalent to 40, 80, 90, and 90 on, or 25.92% on</p>

<p class="f110">(.40 × .80 × .90 ×. 90 = .2592).</p>

<p class="no-indent">The single discount rate equivalent to the series
is, therefore, 74.08% (100%-25.92% = 74.08%).</p>

<p>The <i>order</i> in which the discounts of a series are used is
immaterial, as the order of the factors does not affect the product.</p>

<p>The method just illustrated develops the reason for the first special
rule given above for a series of two discounts. Let the discounts be
“<i>a</i>”% and “<i>b</i>”%. The “percentages on” are, therefore, (1
-<i>a</i>)% and (1-<i>b</i>)% whose product, algebraically, is 1-
[(<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)-<i>ab</i>], which is the single “percentage
on”; from which it is readily seen that the single rate discount is
<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>-<i>ab</i>, i.e., the sum of the two rates minus
their product. Similar rules can be developed for longer series, but
they are too complicated for easy application.</p>

<p>There is now available a “discolog” table, an ingenious reference
table, which is operated somewhat like a logarithmic table. It gives
quickly and easily the single discount rate equivalent to any series of
discounts.</p>

<p>The chief value of the single rate equivalent to the discount series
is in its use for comparative purposes, as it indicates which of two
discount series is the more favorable. When a large number of selling
prices must be computed, all having the same discount series, the
single rate method of calculation also has a great advantage over the
long method, which makes use of the series. This is true especially
when the work is done with the use of a calculating machine.</p>

<p><b>The Nature of Cash Discount—Its Basic Elements.</b>—Where goods
are sold on credit with a cash discount offering, four main factors of
cost, not incurred when goods are sold for cash, must be provided for.
These are:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub2">1. Credit investigation and collection expense.</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Bookkeeping and billing expense.</li>
<li class="isub2">3. Loss from uncollectible accounts.</li>
<li class="isub2">4. Interest for the use of the money—credit.</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
The cash discount is offered to free the vendor especially from costs
(3) and (4), which are the heaviest of the four.</p>

<p>There is a direct relation between the credit period and the loss from
bad debts. Thus, if a credit period of 30 days results in a given
volume of such losses an extension of the credit term to 60 days would
undoubtedly result in increased losses, assuming that all factors, such
as investigation of the risk, credit supervision, collection effort,
etc., remain the same. Inasmuch as the sale price must be sufficiently
high to provide for loss from bad debts, the credit term enters into
the determination of the price.</p>

<p>The other of the two main factors of cost, the interest charge on the
cash sale price, represents the cost of being deprived of the use of
the capital tied up in outstanding accounts.</p>

<p>Thus, when a discount is offered for early settlement, under
normal conditions the controlling factors are the risk or cost of
insurance against loss from bad debts and the interest cost. Special
circumstances, however, may make it expedient to offer more or less
favorable terms of settlement. Normally, terms of 2% off if paid within
10 days, the billed price being on a 30-day credit period (2/10, n/30),
measures two things: (1) the saving secured by receipt of the money
20 days earlier; and (2) the saving in the item of bad debts expense
brought about by shortening the term for which credit is extended from
30 to 10 days. How much of the cash discount is for interest and how
much for bad debts can be seen by comparing the current interest rate,
say 6%, with the discount rate reduced to a yearly basis. A discount of
2% which effects the collection of a debt at the end of 10 days, when
the net credit term is 30 days, secures the use of the money by the
vendor 20 days earlier than the full credit term would effect. 2% for
20 days is equivalent to 36% on a yearly basis.</p>

<p><b>Showing Cash Discount in the Trading Section.</b>—Opinions differ
among accountants as to the proper treatment of cash discounts in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
profit and loss summary at the close of a period. Some maintain that
the discount is a trading or selling item, and show it, therefore, in
the trading section of the statement. Their theory is that discounts
on sales partake somewhat of the nature of trade discounts, that the
real selling price is, after all, what is received for a particular
bill of goods. According to this theory, if goods are billed at $1,000,
and $980 is accepted as full settlement, the sale should be shown
only at $980 on the books. At the time of offering an optional basis
for settlement, however, the merchant does not know which basis the
customer will accept, and he therefore enters the sale on his books at
the highest offer. Later, if the customer settles on the more favorable
option, the discount he takes is logically a deduction from sales.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the discount is explained as a bait offered to
secure customers, it should be treated as a selling cost. Consequently,
on either of these two theories, cash discount would have to be shown
in the trading section of the profit and loss statement, in the one
case as a direct deduction from sales, in the other as a selling cost.</p>

<p><b>Correct Method of Showing Cash Discount.</b>—Other accountants
maintain that cash discount is a financial management item; that a
manager, in order to secure ready funds with which to take advantage
of the discounts offered him on his own purchases, extends to his
customers sufficient inducement to secure the early and prompt payment
of their bills. The difference between the saving on purchases payments
and the cost of securing early payment on sales, is the measure of the
efficiency of such financial policy.</p>

<p>While this explanation of cash discount on sales as a cost of securing
funds may have some foundation, it does not give a fully satisfactory
explanation of the practice. If cash discount has been correctly
analyzed as being composed of the two factors, interest and bad debts
expense, there can be no question as to the place of its showing. Both
factors are financial items and they should therefore be placed in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
section of the profit and loss statement. In this work cash discounts
will be treated as a financial management item.</p>

<p><b>Account Titles for Cash Discounts.</b>—In booking cash discounts,
two accounts are used—one for the discounts on sales, and the other
for the discounts on purchases. Self-descriptive titles are Sales
Discount and Purchases Discount, which seem better than Discounts Allowed
and Discounts Received and other similar titles sometimes met with.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Booking Cash Discount.</b>—In booking cash discounts,
any one of four methods may be used. In <a href="#Page_147">Chapter XIX</a>,
“The Cash Journals,” two of these methods were shown and the explanations will
not be repeated here. Explanations of the other two methods follow.</p>

<p>1. Entry is made only in the cash book through the use of a
non-cash-discount column on the receipts side. This was also fully
explained and illustrated in <a href="#Page_147">Chapter XIX</a>. In the
illustration given there, this discount column was not used in finding
the cash balance, because net cash columns were employed, thus making
unnecessary the use of any other column to find the cash balance.</p>

<p>2. Entry is made as in method 1 above, but the discount column is
used in finding the cash balance. Where, as sometimes happens, the
net cash column is omitted, the true receipts can be found only by
<i>subtracting</i> the amount of the discount from the other column
totals.</p>

<p>The closing summary for the columnar cash book, explained in <a href="#Page_147">Chapter XIX</a>,
shows one method of handling the discount column total. While all
other summary entries for the cash receipts are <i>credits</i>, the
discount summary is a <i>debit</i>. Because of this fact, the discount
total is sometimes shown on the disbursements side of the cash book
among the summary entries of the other columns, in which case the word
“contra” is written after the words “Sales Discount,” showing that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
amount has come from the discount column on the opposite page.
Similarly for the Purchases Discount.</p>

<p>The only advantage of this method is to bring all summary debit
postings on one side of the cash book and all credits on the other.
Where the cash book is operated according to method 2, the closing
summaries are made as shown in <a href="#FORM_42">Form 42</a>, using
columns on the debit side for Customers, Sales Discount, and Sundry;
and on the credit side for Creditors, Purchases Discount, and Sundry.
As there is no net cash column, the totals for Customers and Creditors
are not all cash. To clear them of their non-cash elements, the
discounts can be subtracted from their respective Customers’ and
Creditors’ totals, and only the net brought over into the Sundry
columns; or the subtraction can be effected by adding the discounts
to the opposite side. The use of a Net Cash column simplifies the
summarization of the cash book and should always be employed. Treatment
2 is shown only because it is sometimes met with in practice.</p>

<p><b>Securing Information as to Neglected Discounts.</b>—Some
accountants have pointed out the desirability of bringing before a
manager or proprietor the cost of his failure to take advantage of
discounts offered him. To show this cost the following method of
entering a purchase has been suggested:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Purchases</td>
      <td class="tdr">100.00</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Purchases Discount&emsp; </td>
      <td class="tdr">5.00</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"> </td>
      <td class="tdl_ws2">Vendor</td>
      <td class="tdr"> </td>
      <td class="tdr"> 105.00</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">The <i>net</i> amount of the bill is thus charged
to Purchases, the discount offered to Purchases Discount, and the
Vendor is credited with the billed amount. When payment is made on any
of the optional bases offered, entry is made as follows:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">(1) Vendor<span class="ws2"> </span></td>

                               Balance<br />(Method No. 2)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
In the case of entry (1), the net result of the whole purchase
transaction is a loss or expense of the amount in Purchases Discount,
because of failure to take the discount. In entry (2), if the best
option is taken, viz., the entire 5%, Purchases Discount shows no
balance; any less favorable option, say 2%, results in a debit balance
in Purchases Discount of 3%, measuring the expense incurred through
failure to take the best option. Unquestionably, the information given
a manager by this Purchases Discount debit balance will claim his
notice and immediate attention.</p>

<p>A sales transaction handled on a similar basis results in a Sales
Discount credit balance representing the excess of the offering of
discounts over the amount taken by customers and has to be treated as
income additional to the booked sales income.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the sale or purchase, under this method, must be booked on
a cash option basis, this treatment seems to result in a departure from
true cost or in the mistake of booking only <i>some</i> of the elements
which enter into the cost of merchandise. The price at which a merchant
can sell his product must include all direct and indirect costs and
provide a margin for profit. The sales discount offered is simply one
of these indirect costs. It cannot be more accurately estimated than
can the salesman’s salary which is a part of the sale price. It is
inconsistent practice to separate the invoice price into two elements
and term one <i>real</i> selling price and the other sales discount
cost when the <i>real</i> selling price is still a composite item.
Rather, the sale should be booked at its full invoiced price and actual
costs recorded as they accrue, to be closed out against Sales Income at
the end of the fiscal period.</p>

<p>After all, the sales policy of each concern enters largely into the
determination of its normal selling price. A concern with a normal
credit term of 30 days fixes its sale price on that basis; one with
a 60-day credit term will, in determining its sale price, take into
account the risk and interest costs of the longer credit period; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
one doing a cash business will determine its sale price accordingly.
However, as a means of furnishing the information necessary for
guidance under a particular sales policy, sales should be recorded on
the basis of the normal credit term.</p>

<p>To secure the information sought as to neglected discounts, it is
suggested that memorandum accounts be opened for that purpose and entry
be made of the expense only when incurred. Thus failure to take a
purchase discount would be recorded under these or similar captions:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub3">Neglected Purchase Discounts</li>
<li class="isub7">Reserve for Neglected Purchase Discounts</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time the books are closed these memorandum accounts would be
closed against each other, having served their purpose of giving the
desired information through their inclusion in the trial balance
submitted to the manager or owner.</p>

<p><b>Trade Acceptances and Cash Discounts.</b>—Brief mention should
perhaps be made of some recent discussions of the probable effect of
the extended use of trade acceptances on the practice of allowing
cash discounts. Some sellers, to whom the cash discount practice is
troublesome and unsatisfactory, welcome the use of trade acceptances
as an avenue of escape from the practice. Others have gone so far as
to say that the trade acceptance will eventually do away with cash
discounts. It should be said that the use of trade acceptances, while
attractive from the seller’s standpoint, has not as yet made a strong
appeal to buyers, largely because of the fact that it offers little
that the open account method does not secure for them and it may, on
the other hand, interfere somewhat with the taking of cash discounts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLV<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">BALANCE SHEET VALUATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Two Problems of the Balance Sheet.</b>—There are two major
problems connected with the balance sheet: (1) the problem of form, and
(2) the problem of content. The form of the balance sheet, which was
discussed rather fully in <a href="#Page_22">Chapter III</a>, has to do
with the arrangement of the items for the purpose of intelligent
reading. It deals with the principles in accordance with which the
asset, liability, and net worth items are to be marshaled and set up in
groups and arranged within the group with a view to facilitating the
comparisons between groups and the calculations made in judging the
financial condition of the concern.</p>

<p>The second problem of the balance sheet, that of content, which
was also mentioned in <a href="#Page_22">Chapter III</a>, concerns itself
mainly with the valuation of the items in the balance sheet, assuming
of course that all the assets and liabilities are included in the
statement. A balance sheet may be correct in form but, unless its
content is reliable, it has little or no value when judged from the
standpoint of its chief purpose, namely, that of showing the financial
condition of the concern. The problem of the form of the balance sheet
has to do with the technical or mechanical side of accounting, while
the problem of its content or the valuation of its items has to do
with the questions of the concern’s financial administration, for the
solution of which the accounting department must furnish in proper form
the necessary information.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Value.</b>—It is first necessary to state the limitations
within which the principles of valuation to be laid down are applicable
to the commercial balance sheet. In business many different kinds of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
value are found and used. Thus we have the terms, sale or liquidation
value, cost value, and replacement value. By the term “sale value,”
when applied to a going business, is meant the value which a willing
buyer offers to a willing seller. “Liquidation value” means the value
or price offered for a commodity or an entire business when the concern
is winding up its affairs and going out of business. Liquidation is,
therefore, forced value. There is thus a marked difference between sale
value and liquidation value. The term “cost value” is understood to
mean the price paid for a purchased article. From the discussion of the
principles of debit and credit as applied to merchandise and to fixed
assets, it has been shown that the price paid should include not alone
the invoice cost but the other expenditures needed to put the article
purchased in such a position that it can be used by the business in the
customary way. Replacement value means the cost to replace an article.
It differs from first cost mainly in that the price level may have
changed between the date of the original purchase and the present time.
Thus, because of the changes in prices, an article, costing $1,000 in
1914, might have had a replacement cost of $1,800 in 1917, and $1,400
in 1922.</p>

<p>Manifestly, before the principles to be followed in valuing balance
sheet items can be laid down, there must be some understanding as to
what kind of value is under discussion. The kind of value used in the
ordinary commercial balance sheet is termed “going concern value.”
By this is meant the value which is applied to a going business—a
business which expects to continue in operation, not one which expects
to sell out to other owners nor one which expects to discontinue
operations.</p>

<p><b>Source of Data as to Values.</b>—In a going concern the information
as to value is found chiefly in the books of account. The data in the
accounting records are, of course, supported by the original documents
evidencing the purchases and sales. It is a necessary corollary that if
the books of account are to give reliable information as to values, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
correct analysis must be made of all transactions previous to their
entry. Mention was made in an earlier chapter of the necessity of
a clear differentiation between capital and revenue charges and
the effect of failure to make such differentiation. If at the time
of an expenditure a correct classification of accounts has been
made, particularly of the broad classes of assets, liabilities, and
proprietorship, the accounts should reflect the true values as of the
various dates of record. For purposes of detailed information it is
equally necessary that a correct classification be made of the accounts
affected by an entry within any of these main groups. It has been seen
that because of practical difficulties no effort is made to have the
accounts reflect day by day the correct value of the various items. It
is considered sufficient to bring the book record into agreement with
the facts in respect to value once each fiscal period, namely, at its
close. The true financial condition and correct operating results are
then determined.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that a correct analysis of every transaction
recorded in the accounts is an absolute prerequisite to the use of
the accounts for determining correct values. It is very vital that a
clear line of demarcation be maintained between capital and revenue
expenditures—that great care be exercised that no cost is charged
into the asset group of accounts unless such cost really enhances the
worth of an asset. A cost incurred for the purpose of maintaining the
value of the asset is an expense charge, and repairs and maintenance
charges must be very carefully distinguished from replacements.
<i>Maintenance</i> has to do with those costs which maintain an asset
in good operating condition; <i>repairs</i> have to do with those costs
necessary to put an asset in operating condition after a condition of
inefficiency has been reached which the maintenance costs have not been
able to prevent; a <i>replacement</i> cost is incurred when it becomes
necessary to replace some part or the whole of an asset, neither
maintenance cost nor repair costs having been able to maintain the
asset in efficient operating condition. Where only a part of an asset
is to be replaced, it is often spoken of as a <i>renewal</i> of parts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
When so used, the term “replacement” is limited to the renewal or the
replacement of the whole asset.</p>

<p>When a renewal or replacement is made, it becomes necessary to
determine whether the cost of the renewal or replacement is more than
the cost of the part or the whole replaced. For example, if an asset
costing originally $1,000 is replaced by one costing $1,200, there has
manifestly been an addition of $200 to the value of the asset. The new
asset may be an exact duplicate of the old but if prices have risen so
that the new actually costs more than the old, the books must record
the asset at its new cost value. The amount by which a new asset or
part of an asset exceeds the cost of the old asset or old part is
called a <i>betterment</i>. A betterment is always an asset.</p>

<p>The student will readily see that at times it must be difficult to draw
the line between repairs and replacements. In practice the line is
usually drawn only when the expenditure exceeds a certain amount. This
amount is not uniform and is determined by each individual business.
For example, when the cost of placing the asset in efficient condition
for operation is less than, say, $100, it is charged as repair cost and
therefore does not increase the book value of the asset. If the cost
exceeds $100, an analysis is made to determine what portion of it, if
any, increases the value of the asset. The amount of the betterment
is of course a charge to the asset account, while the rest of it is a
charge to some expense account.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Special Items.</b>—In the determination of the
classification of charges, some kinds of items require special
consideration:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Organization Expense.</span> The group
of expenditures explained in <a href="#Page_330">Chapter XXXVIII</a>,
as incident to the organization of a corporation, is recorded under the
title “Organization Expenses” and is classified for purposes of the
balance sheet as an asset. It is a kind of asset, however, which has no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
tangible value and most businesses desire to consider it more in the
nature of a deferred charge to operations. It is recognized that
frequently intangible assets add no strength to the business. While,
therefore, in strict theory organization expenses are assets, in
practice it is best to write them off against income during a period of
from three to five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cost-Cutting Changes.</span> Another similar
class of charges is met in costs incurred in making changes in the
arrangement of building and other facilities which will tend to bring
about a more economical handling of some phases of the business; for
example, a rearrangement of a receiving and packing room in order to
facilitate the receipt and delivery of goods. Where these costs are
inconsiderable it is best to charge them against the income of the
period in which they are incurred. Where, however, a big expenditure
is necessary, it seems best to set the costs up under a suitable
descriptive title and spread them over several periods. In other words,
at the date of their incurrence the costs are treated as an asset whose
value is to be written down at the end of successive fiscal periods
until finally it has all been charged against the operations of the
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interest During Construction Period.</span>
Where a business builds its own home, all costs incurred during
the period of construction are proper charges to the costs of the
construction. Thus, if a mortgage or bond issue is used as a means of
partially financing construction of the building, the interest paid to
the mortgagee or bondholders during the period of construction is a
proper charge to the building account. Costs of this kind follow the
general principle laid down previously, that all costs up to the point
of placing the asset in condition ready for use are proper charges to
the asset.</p>

<p><b>Basic Rules for Valuation of Balance Sheet Groups.</b>—We may now
consider the principles applicable to the valuation of the various
groups on the balance sheet. In the standard form of balance sheet the
assets are divided into the three groups: (1) Current, (2) Deferred
Charges, and (3) Fixed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span></p>

<p>It has been seen that the assets of the current group are used
for purposes of settling debts, the payment of expenses, and the
purchase of merchandise. In judging the sufficiency of these assets
for this purpose, it is absolutely essential to know that the values
at which they are carried will be realized when they are converted
into cash. From the standpoint of conservative business management
an understatement of realizable value may be made, but never an
overstatement. Accordingly, the fundamental principle of valuation
applicable to this group is that these assets are to be valued at cost
or market, whichever is the lower. When so valued, the figures at which
they are carried in the balance sheet will usually represent an amount
slightly less than the amount which it is expected will be realized
from their conversion into cash.</p>

<p>The function of the deferred charges group of assets is to secure
an equitable distribution of expense charges between the current and
the following period. It is only because certain expenditures have
been made during the current period which will benefit the succeeding
period, that it is necessary to set up this group of assets. Here the
problem of valuation is, therefore, simply the problem of dividing the
cost of the expenditures between the current and the next period on
the basis of the benefits accruing to each. In some cases the basis of
division is one of time, as where an insurance policy is purchased for
a definite term. The portion of the policy which has expired during
the current period is the portion of its cost to be charged to the
current period, the balance being deferred to succeeding periods and
therefore carried as an asset. In other cases a physical inventory is
necessary to determine the distribution of the cost of expenditures,
as when supplies of fuel have been purchased and not entirely consumed
during the current period. The basis of the value carried over to the
next period is of course a fair portion of the original cost. Market
or replacement cost does not have any effect on the valuation of the
deferred portion.</p>

<p>Fixed assets are acquired as more or less permanent equipment without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
which it is impossible to operate the business. The time during which
an asset continues in use is the customary basis for a classification
of its cost as between expenses and fixed assets. Thus, an asset
acquired for purposes of business operation which, however, will be
used up completely during the current period is charged immediately
to some expense account, whereas an asset which will continue in use
over several periods is charged to an asset account. Fixed asset
purchases are never for purposes of resale. It is expected that they
will continue in use until they are discarded because of failure to
perform the service for which they were acquired. Neither the sale
value nor the replacement cost value of such assets has, therefore, any
influence on their value to the business. That value is the full cost
adjusted periodically by an equitable distribution of that cost over
the operations of the periods benefited by the services rendered by the
asset. This principle of valuation is usually expressed by the formula,
cost less depreciation.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>Valuation of Assets</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cash.</span> Cash as carried on the balance
sheet is the asset which is used, without conversion, for payment of
the liabilities of the business. There should, therefore, ordinarily be
no problem of valuation. However, because of the practice of including
checks, drafts and notes due and in course of collection, cash balances
held abroad and therefore subject to the fluctuations of exchange, and
other similar items in the account Cash, it is oftentimes necessary
to examine all these items carefully and arrive at a figure which
represents the amount expected to be realized from them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notes and Accounts Receivable.</span> The claims
against customers, both on note and open accounts, constitute an
intermediate step in the conversion of merchandise into cash. At the
time credit is extended to a customer it is expected that he will pay
the amount due. The experience of every business man shows, however,
that during each period there is a shrinkage in these claims due to
some customers failing to pay the amounts they owe. In valuing these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
claims it is therefore necessary to take cognizance of the amount of the
shrinkage. This amount is different in different businesses, depending
on the length of the credit term, the policy as to investigation of
credit risks, and on the rigor of the collections policy. On the basis
of the experience within a given business, it is therefore necessary to
make an estimate of the loss from uncollectible accounts.</p>

<p>The manner of making the record of estimated bad debts has already been
explained. The reason for placing the amount by which the asset is
estimated to shrink as a credit in the Reserve for Doubtful Accounts
account rather than in the Accounts Receivable account has also been
explained. The custom of estimating the amount of loss on the basis
of the sales for the period rather than on the amount of claims
outstanding at the close of the fiscal period has been referred to.
Here it is desired to explain the manner of handling the reserve at the
time claims are definitely determined uncollectible. Until a claim is
determined uncollectible it is carried as a part of the assets, Notes
or Accounts Receivable. The amount of the estimated shrinkage in these
assets due to failure to collect claims is indicated by the Reserve for
Doubtful Accounts account. This amount cannot be applied directly to
particular notes and accounts until it is definitely known that such
notes and accounts cannot be collected. When that is learned, it is
necessary to transfer from the reserve account the amount needed to
cancel from the books the uncollectible notes and accounts receivable.
This is done by the following entry:</p>

<ul class="index fontsize_110">
<li class="isub3">Reserve for Doubtful Accounts</li>
<li class="isub7">Notes (and Accounts) Receivable</li>
</ul>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> Assume that the accounts receivable
amount to $75,000, of which it is estimated that $5,000
will not be collectible. During the succeeding period
a customer owing $500 becomes bankrupt and nothing is
realized on his account.</p>

<p>The accounts will then appear as follows:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
It will thus be seen that the decrease in value of the accounts
receivable as estimated by the amount in the Reserve for Doubtful
Accounts can never be applied to the asset until it is definitely
determined what particular customer’s account included in the Accounts
Receivable account is bad and must therefore be written off the books.
Inasmuch as the Bad Debts account set up at the close of each fiscal
period to indicate the loss or expense due to uncollectible accounts,
has been charged as an expense of operating for that period, it would
manifestly be duplicating the expense charge if a debt that proved
bad were charged to the Bad Debts account rather than to the Reserve
for Doubtful Accounts. Only during the first period of operation of
a business are debts, if determined bad during that period, charged
to the Bad Debts account. Even here, if it is expected at the close
of the first period to base the estimate of uncollectible accounts
on the sales for the period rather than on the amount of outstanding
accounts at the end of the period, it would be necessary to charge the
debts becoming bad during the period against the Reserve for Doubtful
Accounts account—even though at the time of the charge it contained no
credit entries—and not to the Bad Debts account. The desirability of
establishing a standard routine for the handling of all items should be
kept in mind. Best practice, therefore, demands that all debts shall
be charged against the Reserve for Doubtful Accounts whenever they
are determined to be bad, regardless of the amount held in reserve in
that account. If such practice creates a debit balance in the Reserve
for Doubtful Accounts, it is an indication that the estimate of
uncollectible accounts made in previous periods has not, as a matter
of fact, been sufficient and a larger estimate must be made for future
periods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Merchandise.</span> Merchandise is purchased for
the purpose of resale at a profit. Sale price is dependent, in a free
market, on the force of demand and supply and not at any given time on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
cost. Until the goods are sold no profit, as a matter of fact, has
been secured. Conservatism, therefore, demands that sale price should
not ordinarily be used as the basis for the inventory valuation.
Unless there has been a decided change in prices, it is the confident
expectation of the management that at least the cost price of the
merchandise will be realized when the goods are sold. Ordinarily,
therefore, merchandise will be priced in the balance sheet at cost.
When, however, there has been a change in price levels, particularly
when the indication is that there is a generally declining market
and not simply a temporary fluctuation in prices, it is the part of
conservatism to value the merchandise at its replacement cost, or
even at a lower figure, if stocks are large and market conditions
are such that customers are withholding their purchases until price
levels have dropped still further. The basic principle for valuing all
current assets requires that they be valued as nearly as possible at
the realization figure. Therefore, the amount expected to be realized
governs or influences the valuation basis. The valuation formula or
rule-of-thumb method, in accordance with which merchandise inventory is
usually valued, is expressed as cost or market, whichever is the lower.
As indicated above, there are times when exception is taken to this
basis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Investments.</span> Stocks and bonds
representing the investment of temporary surpluses of cash are valued
on a realization basis. Inasmuch as the tying up of cash in these
securities is only temporary and it is expected that they will be
converted again into cash as needed, the amount which can be realized
from their sale on the date of the balance sheet is the amount to
be considered when judging the financial condition on that date. A
large amount of discretion must be used in valuing these securities,
because of the violent fluctuations to which quotations on the various
stock exchanges are subject. Here also conservatism does not usually
authorize value at the market if the market is higher than the cost.
Accordingly, the valuation formula is cost or market, whichever is the
lower.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accrued Income.</span> The income accrued on
the date of the balance sheet is determined on the basis of a fair
distribution between the periods during which the income accrues.
Thus, the income from money loaned during the current period but not
due until a succeeding period must be distributed over two or more
periods. Where the income is dependent on time, the portion applicable
to the current period is determined on a time basis. Where the income
is dependent on some other basis, such as sales or units of work done,
the portion applicable to the current period is determined by the ratio
of the whole to the amount completed during the present period. Thus,
in the case of a contract entered into to sell goods on a commission
basis, the commission income accrued during the current period will
usually be based on the amount of sales made during that period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deferred Charges.</span> The valuation principle
for deferred charges has been stated above in connection with the
principles of valuation to be applied to the various groups of accounts
on the balance sheet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fixed Assets.</span> Fixed assets may usually
be divided into two classes: (1) assets not subject to depreciation,
and (2) assets subject to depreciation. The usual example of assets
not subject to depreciation is the land on which a building stands.
Land used for growing crops may easily be subject to depreciation. Land
subject to the exploitation of the natural resources under its surface
is similarly subject to depreciation. To distinguish the decrease in
value of such natural resources because of the fact that they enter
into and become a part of the commodity dealt in, the term “depletion”
is used. Thus, a coal mine or oil well decreases in value with every
unit of product taken therefrom. It is not purposed hero to discuss
the principles of valuation applicable in such cases, the assets under
discussion being limited in meaning to those of a mercantile business.
(See Volume II, page 312, for a discussion of depletion.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span></p>

<p>The valuation formula for assets not subject to depreciation is cost.
Increase in value due to changed market conditions is not usually to be
taken account of.</p>

<p>The second group of assets, those subject to depreciation, are to be
valued on the basis of original cost less the amount of depreciation
accrued to the date of the balance sheet. The valuation of such assets,
therefore, requires the determination of the amount of depreciation.</p>

<p>Depreciation arises from several causes, the chief of which are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Wear and tear, due to use.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Decrepitude or age, due to lapse of time.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Obsolescence, due to a changed demand for the
article or to an advance in the arts which makes the continued use of
the asset uneconomical.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. Inadequacy, brought about by several causes,
one of which may be the change in the market which renders the asset
inadequate for furnishing the product or service in the amount
required.</p>
</div>

<p>Obsolescence and inadequacy, because of their very nature, are
usually difficult of determination and frequently cannot therefore
be considered in determining the amount of depreciation accrued at a
given time. Where measurable they should, of course, be taken into
account. Depreciation due to lapse of time is calculable on a time
basis. Depreciation due to wear and tear is calculable on the basis
of the use to which the asset has been subjected. It is in practice
difficult to separate these two types of depreciation. The estimate
for depreciation is in the majority of cases made on a time basis.
In manufacturing establishments, oftentimes a use or output basis
proves more satisfactory. These more difficult problems met in the
determination of depreciation are discussed in Volume II. Here only the
most usual method of depreciation estimate on a time basis, known as
the straight-line method, will be explained.</p>

<p>For determining the periodic amount of depreciation of any asset it is
necessary to know: (1) the original cost of the asset; (2) its scrap
value, that is, the estimated value as scrap on the day it is junked;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
and (3) the estimated life of the asset in years or fiscal periods. The
following symbols will be used in working out the formula:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl"><i>V₁</i></td>
      <td class="tdc"> = </td>
      <td class="tdl">Original value.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"><i>Vₙ</i></td>
      <td class="tdc"> = </td>
      <td class="tdl">Scrap value at the end of <i>n</i> years, its estimated life.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"><i>n</i></td>
      <td class="tdc"> = </td>
      <td class="tdl">The estimated number of years in the life of the asset.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"><i>D</i></td>
      <td class="tdc"> = </td>
      <td class="tdl">The amount of depreciation during a period.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdl"><i>r</i></td>
      <td class="tdc"> = </td>
      <td class="tdl">The rate to be applied to <i>V₁</i> in order to determine <i>D</i>.</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>It is apparent that <big><i>V₁</i>-<i>Vₙ</i></big> is the amount to be
depreciated over the life of the asset. The amount to be charged off
periodically as depreciation is, therefore:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>V₁</i> - <i>Vₙ</i></td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>n</i></td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">Accordingly</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>V₁</i> - <i>Vₙ</i>  </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>D</i>  =&emsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<span class="ws2">(1)</span></td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>n</i></td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>The amount to be written off each year is thus seen to be constant. The
percentage to be applied to the original cost in order to determine
the periodic depreciation <i>D</i> is, therefore, found by dividing
<i>D</i> by <i>V₁</i>. Hence the formula:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>D</i>    </td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>r</i>  =   &mdash;<span class="ws2">(2)</span></td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc"><i>V₁</i>    </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Having determined by careful estimate the method of calculating the
periodic amount of depreciation, the problem of valuation of the asset
at any given time during its life is ordinarily simple. In the case of
renewal of any parts, the question of betterment comes in and requires
careful handling. In unusual cases it may often be necessary to revise
the rate of depreciation in order to write off the betterment during
the remaining life of the asset. Depreciation is at the best but an
estimate and unless there are major betterment items it is not usually
necessary because of them to revise the estimate of depreciation. When
a renewal takes place it is theoretically necessary to determine the
value of the replaced part at the time of its replacement. The excess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
of the cost of the new part over this value is the amount of the
betterment, when only the values of the old and new parts are
considered. In such cases, however, the new part will not usually
have value apart from the asset to which it is attached. In practice,
therefore, the amount of the betterment recorded is the difference
between original—not present—value of the old part and the cost of
the new part. An example will illustrate the problems involved and the
accounting treatment.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> Assume
that an asset—office equipment—costing $1,000 has an estimated life of
ten years and no scrap value. After six years of this life it becomes
necessary to replace a part of the asset, estimated to have cost
originally $100, the cost of the new part being $150. At the time of
the replacement the depreciation reserve carries an amount of $600.</p>

<p>The first step in booking the transaction is to transfer from the
reserve account to the asset account the original cost of the part
replaced. Just as in the case of bad debts, now that a part of the
asset has been discarded and the amount of the decrease in value of
the asset is definitely known, this amount held in suspense until the
present time in the reserve account must be applied as a definite
reduction in the carrying value of the asset. The entry to effect the
transfer is:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Depreciation Reserve, Office Appliances</td>
      <td class="tdr">  100.00</td>

   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>The next step is to set up the cost of the new part which replaces that
discarded. This follows the usual entry at the time of purchase of any
equipment. The entry needed is:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Office Appliances<span class="ws6"> </span></td>

      <td class="tdr">  150.00</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc" colspan="4"> </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">The student will note that the office appliances
account now carries a value of $1,050, of which the $50 represents the
value of the betterment.</p>

<p>It might appear that since the renewal occurs at the end of six years
there has been accumulated in the reserve by that time only $60
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
covering this specific part, and that therefore only $60 should be
transferred from the reserve account, the other $40 being charged to a
proprietorship account to represent the additional expense or loss not
yet provided for by the depreciation charges during the past six years.
That is not the situation, however, for if the periodic depreciation
has been correctly estimated, the entire amount, $100, has already been
charged off and is therefore included in the reserve. When the asset
was originally installed and the length of its life estimated for the
purpose of determining the periodic depreciation charge, the policy
as to repairs and renewal of parts was taken into consideration. Such
estimates cannot, of course, be absolutely accurate. However, until
such time as a definite basis is given on which to check the amount
of the over-or under-estimate, it is the standard practice to charge
against the reserve the original value of the renewed part. Always at
the time of discard of the entire asset—and sometimes sooner—such
a definite basis is given and adjustment must be made in accordance
with the facts then ascertained. A problem will illustrate the
considerations involved.</p>

<p>Continuing the foregoing example, assume that the office appliance,
now valued at $1,050 with a reserve of $500, is discarded after ten
and a half years’ service.</p>

<p>At the end of the tenth year the annual depreciation charge of $105
will have brought the reserve account to a total of $920. Six months
later, at the time of discard of the asset, there will be accrued
depreciation, not yet booked, amounting to $52.50. It is, accordingly,
necessary to book this amount by means of the following entry:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Depreciation</td>

 </tbody>
</table>

<p>This entry charges the current period with its share of the consumed
value of the asset. The next step is to transfer the reserve account
to the asset account, to show in that account the amount of the
inaccuracy in the depreciation estimate—the amount by which the actual
depreciation differs from the estimate. The entry is:

<p class="no-indent">The office appliance account now shows a debit
balance of $77.50, which indicates the value or amount of the asset
which has been consumed but which has not been charged against the
income of the periods during which the asset was used. It is manifestly
inequitable to charge this amount against the income of the six months
of the current period, and it is impossible to go back and spread it
over the previous periods because their records have been closed. The
charge must therefore be made direct to the Surplus account in the case
of a corporation, or to a final section for extraordinary profits and
losses of the regular Profit and Loss account in other cases. It may be
handled by this latter method also in the case of a corporation. The
entry needed is, therefore:</p>

paid for the latter’s good-will. In other words, good-will is not
brought on to the books until a purchase determines its market value.
Where good-will is purchased, it is customary to carry it at its
cost value. Depreciation is not taken into account. Because of the
intangible nature of good-will and its more or less speculative value,
some businesses prefer not to show it. In such cases it may be written

disappeared from the books. While, therefore, good-will is not subject
to depreciation, it is subject to this writing off process, which
usually bears little or no relationship to time. It should not be
charged against the profit of any period or several periods, but when
written off should be charged direct against surplus.</p>

<p><b>Liabilities.</b>—The problem of valuation of liabilities is simple.
From the standpoint of a going concern, its liabilities decrease only
when they are paid off, and increase only because of services or
assets purchased and not paid for. The main problem in connection with
balance sheet liabilities is the determination of the fact that all
liabilities are shown on the balance sheet. This oftentimes involves
the consideration of contingent liabilities. The amount of a liability
may sometimes be in dispute, in which case a careful and conservative
estimate of the probable amount must be made and shown.</p>

<p><b>Proprietorship.</b>—Since proprietorship is always the difference
between assets and liabilities, the problems of valuation of
proprietorship are solved almost automatically if the valuation of
assets and liabilities have been handled properly. There may sometimes
be problems in connection with the various items in the proprietorship
group. These concern surplus, undivided profits, and various reserves.
The problems here are largely those of determining whether a company
has lived up to its contract or other agreements in the maintenance of
the proper values in the various proprietorship accounts.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion.</b>—The problems of valuation are vital to any
business and intimately concern its financial integrity. In order to
maintain at least the original capital investment in a business, it
is necessary to make provision for the decrease in asset values due
to different causes. The financial management of the business must
watch this feature closely, else capital will be dissipated and the
business rendered incapable of performing the functions for which it
was organized.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">BUYING AND STOCK CONTROL</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Importance of Buying.</b>—Buying as a major function in a
mercantile concern is intimately related to, and dependent on, the
other functions of the business. Buying must always have regard to
the sales activities. To buy without reference to the ability to
sell is suicidal. Both overbuying—buying more than can be disposed
of at a profit—and underbuying—buying less than is needed to meet
the sales demand—are conditions to be avoided. Underbuying means
a loss of sales. Unless their needs are met promptly in accordance
with their orders, customers will go elsewhere. Overbuying means the
unnecessary tying up of capital in a stock of goods which increases
the possibilities of loss resulting from changes in fashions and the
level of prices. The relation of the rate of turnover to profits in
merchandising was discussed in <a href="#Page_57">Chapter VII</a>.
Manifestly the ideal situation, so far as the amount of stock carried
is concerned, is one in which the least amount of capital is used to
provide an adequate stock for meeting the requirements of customers
and in which the loss from unsalable stock is reduced to the lowest level.</p>

<p>Many business houses fail to realize the wastes resulting from slow
turnovers. The Chamber of Commerce of the United States has called
attention to these losses and has analyzed them under the following
heads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The unnecessary use of capital in merchandise
that could be more profitably employed in other
productive sources.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. The increased cost of borrowed capital, the
carrying of larger stocks and their slow turnover, necessitating the
borrowing of larger amounts of capital for longer periods.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. The marking down of the sale price due to the
fact that the goods will not move at the higher sale price.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. An increase in overhead expenses due to the
larger storage and display equipment needed for goods and to the costs
incident to handling the larger stock, and re-marking the stock when it
is necessary to lower sale prices.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. The loss of prestige and reputation from
carrying unstylish and shopworn goods.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Relation between Buying and Finance.</b>—From what has already been
said, it is evident that there is a very necessary relation between
the buying policy of a business and its ability to finance purchases.
Even though it may be possible to increase sales, unless the business
is in a position to finance not only the additional credits extended to
customers but also the additional purchases needed to take care of the
increased sales, it will not be feasible to pursue a policy of sales
expansion and therefore of increased buying. Hence, buying cannot be
considered as a business activity by itself, but as one dependent upon
the sales activities and the financial resources of the business.</p>

<p><b>Organization for Buying.</b>—In large merchandising businesses
the duties and authority of the buying department are not uniform. In
some, this department is organized entirely distinct from the selling
department; in others (and this is particularly true of the large
department stores), the buyer is head merchandise man with control
over the selling activities of the business. It is also quite usual
for the buyer to be in charge of a given department and his success
or failure to be judged by the profits he makes in that department.
A profit quota is sometimes assigned to each department, for which the
buyer is responsible. In other words, in the management of the buying
and selling activities and therefore in the control of his merchandise
stock the buyer is supreme, subject to the general limitations placed
by the financial resources at his disposal. Under the control of the
buyer, therefore, will be stock clerks, the clerks which mark and
re-mark the merchandise, and the sales force. Above and in control of
all the departmental buyers is usually an executive or high official of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
the company whose chief function is to correlate the activities of the
buyers with the concern’s general buying, selling, and financial policy.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics of the Buyer.</b>—To perform his functions
properly, the buyer must be a man of broad experience, with a keen
sense of values and the marketing possibilities of merchandise. On
the buying side he must have complete information as to the available
sources of the merchandise he desires to secure, both in staple and
in novelty lines. On the selling side he must know the demands of his
customers and the possibility of creating new demands. The best index
of the buying power of his customers is the volume of sales made in
previous years. Past performance, considered in connection with general
trade conditions and plans for the further development of the business,
is the only basis for judging the sales possibilities of the future. He
must know the quality of merchandise and the reliability of the people
from whom he buys. He must be a keen judge of prices. He must know the
financial resources of his own store and strive to secure the best
possible credit and discount terms.</p>

<p><b>Buying Procedure.</b>—In <a href="#Page_185">Chapter XXII</a>,
where the goods invoice was discussed, a typical purchasing procedure
was set forth. Here only the chief points in that procedure will be
mentioned. In a large establishment the buying requisition should be
the basis of all purchase orders. This is particularly true when the
buyer does the buying for several departments. The requisition should
be made out in triplicate by the department head, two copies going to
the buyer and one being retained in the department. Upon the issuance
of the buying order, the second copy of the requisition is returned to
the department as evidence that the goods have been ordered.</p>

<p>The purchase orders are made in manifold, the original going to the
vendor, one copy to the treasurer to notify him of the future need for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
funds, one to the controller or accounting department, and one being
retained by the buyer as a basis for follow-up. Upon receipt of the
invoice, which usually precedes the goods, the buyer compares it with
the order and if it is found correct, he passes it to the accounting
department, where it is held until the receiving slip, showing the
receipt of goods, is received from the receiving room. If the three
documents now in possession of the accounting department, namely,
the copy of the original order, the invoice, and the receiving slip,
agree, the invoice is passed for entry on the books and is filed for
payment in accordance with the financial policy of the business. After
payment, the invoice with its supporting documents is filed. Great care
must be exercised to make sure that an invoice is not put through more
than once for payment and that every invoice represents goods properly
ordered and actually received.</p>

<p><b>Requirements of Successful Buying.</b>—Successful buying rests
on a knowledge of two things: (1) when to buy, and (2) what to buy.
The timeliness of buying has regard rather to the sales requirements
than the market possibilities. Goods are bought for the purpose of
satisfying needs of customers. A knowledge of the trend of the market
is necessary but buying wholly in accordance with market trends too
often leads to speculation in merchandise, due weight not being given
to the sales requirements. A knowledge of the specific commodities
needed to satisfy the requirements of customers is equally important.
The regular use of the “want slips” of customers calling for goods
not in stock is one source of information. The records of the paid
“shoppers” as to the commodities and prices of competitors is also
some indication.</p>

<p>In answering both these questions, when to buy and what to buy,
the records of the business itself should furnish the fundamental
information needed to secure a proper control of the movement
of merchandise. Some system of perpetual inventory is almost
indispensable. In a small business where the buyer, usually the owner,
is in intimate contact with all departments, a fairly satisfactory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
control of merchandise can be secured without a perpetual inventory. In
a business of some size, however, the perpetual inventory is an almost
absolute essential if movement of stock is to be kept under control.</p>

<p><b>Control of Merchandise Movement.</b>—The beginning of merchandise
control is the fixing of the sales quota, that is, the making of an
estimate of sales for the next period. Without a definite goal to be
aimed at control is impossible. Buying and finance are dependent on it.
A knowledge of the stock on hand at any time is needed to determine
the buying requirements. Even in a small business the inventory can at
least be estimated on the basis of past performance as to percentage of
gross profit and therefore the percentage of cost of goods sold. The
application of this figure of percentage of cost of goods sold to the
sales for the period gives the cost of goods sold, which, subtracted
from the opening inventory plus goods purchased, gives an estimate of
the goods in stock. A perpetual inventory kept by quantities rather
than by values serves the purpose in many establishments. What is
known as the “retail system,” by means of which the value of the stock
on hand can be estimated at any time, is used in many large retail
establishments. In addition to, and in conjunction with such a system,
the use of commodity control cards, as illustrated in <a href="#FORM_43">Form 43</a>,
gives a sure index of the condition of stock and the movement of
merchandise at any time.</p>

<p><b>The Retail Method of Inventory.</b>—The retail system of inventory
is based on the carrying of all goods purchased at a retail sale price
as well as at cost price. In the financial records purchases are, of
course, always booked at cost. A stock record is kept, however, which
carries purchases at retail sale price as well as at cost price. The
principle of the perpetual inventory under this method is shown by the
fundamental formula:</p>

<p class="f120">Opening Inventory + Purchases- Cost of Goods Sold</p>
<p class="f120">= Final Inventory<span class="ws8"> </span></p>

<p>It is apparent that if all the values on the left side of the equation
are retail sale values, the right side of the equation represents the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
final inventory valued at the retail sale price. Thus, if the opening
inventory for use in the stock record is set up at the marked sale
price, and purchases are similarly set up, the subtraction of the sales
to date from the sum of the opening inventory and purchases gives the
amount of stock on hand valued at the sale price.</p>

<p>In order to reduce an inventory, valued at retail sale price, to a cost
basis, the per cent of mark-on of the cost price to give the original
sale price must be applied. This per cent is based on the sale price
and not the cost price, being determined by dividing the difference
between sale and cost price (that is, the gross profit figure) by the
sale price. Thus, a commodity, costing $60 and marked to sell at $100,
will, if sold, yield a gross profit of $40, which, given in terms of
the sale price, is a 40% gross profit. This 40% is spoken of as the
“mark-on per cent.” The cost is, therefore, the difference between 100%
and the per cent of mark-on, in this case 60%. That is, 60% of the sale
price gives the cost price.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to reduce the inventory value at selling price to a cost
price basis, it must be multiplied by 100% minus the per cent of
mark-on.</p>

<p>The use of the retail method is thus seen to require a stock record
from which the goods on hand as valued at selling price can be
determined almost instantly and from which the per cent of mark-on can
also be determined. In principle the method is simple. In practice
it must be operated very carefully, else unreliable results will be
secured. It seldom happens that merchandise will always move at the
marked sale price. Adjustments are necessary. On an upward market,
perhaps, a higher price can be secured than the marked price. On a
downward market or in order to move certain colors and styles, it is
necessary to mark down from the original sale price. The fluctuations
arising from mark-ups and mark-downs are treated in Chapter XI of
Volume III and will not be discussed here. Some applications of the
retail method will be explained, however.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span></p>

<p><b>Some Buying Records and Their Use.</b>—The chief purpose of the
main records kept in business is the securing of control over the
activities of the business. The control over merchandise must always be
based on records. The first step in securing the necessary control is
a proper departmentization of stock. Analysis of purchases and sales
by departments is fundamental. In addition, a knowledge of what others
in the same line are doing serves as a criterion by which to judge
one’s own results. Trade associations and research bureaus are giving
invaluable information by furnishing standards for judging results.</p>

<p>Three major problems from the buyer’s standpoint are always met. They
are not independent problems but, as indicated above, are intimately
related to selling and financial policies. These problems are: (1) the
determination of the average stock to be carried; (2) the determination
of the buying quota for a given period; and (3) the determination of
the “open-to-buy” amount at a given time. Too often these matters are
decided in a haphazard fashion. Only by means of a careful analysis of
all the factors and the results obtained in the various departments as
compared with average or standard results can a sound basis of stock
control be secured.</p>

<p><b>Average Stock to be Carried.</b>—Stock control rests, in the first
place, on estimated requirements for the future. Estimates for the
future must always be based on past performance, as modified by present
market conditions and contemplated changes in basic merchandising
policies. In estimating the amount of stock to be carried, the volume
of expected sales must be taken into account. The other factor is the
rate at which the merchandise should turn during the period. Thus, if
estimates are made for a period of six months, the estimated sales for
the period divided by the number of times the stock is expected to
turn during the six months will give the average amount of stock to
be kept on hand. Seasonal fluctuations must be taken cognizance of in
determining the changes from average stocks to be carried at particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
times during the period. Thus, if the estimated sales in a given
department are $50,000 for the next six months and the merchandise
turns twice during that time, manifestly a stock of $25,000, as priced
at retail, must be carried. If the mark-on is 40%, the cost of the
average stock will be 60% of $25,000, or $15,000, representing the
average capital to be tied up in stock for that department.</p>

<p><b>The Buying Quota.</b>—The determination of a buying quota for a
given period must take cognizance of the stock on hand at the beginning
of the period, the stock which it is planned to have on hand at the end
of the period, and the estimated sales for the period. If, from the sum
of the stock planned to be on hand at the end of the period and the
sales estimate for the period is subtracted the stock on hand at the
beginning of the period, the buying quota for the period is determined.
This buying quota is, of course, at retail price and must be reduced
by use of the mark-on percentage to a cost basis. An illustration will
show the method:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

</table>

<p><b>The “Open-to-Buy” Estimate.</b>—The buying quota is estimated at
the beginning of the period. At various times throughout the period, if
stock is to be properly controlled, it is necessary to know how much
of the buying quota is available. Furthermore, because estimates made
at the beginning of the period never quite coincide with the facts of
actual performance, it is necessary to take cognizance of these data of
performance in determining the amount of stock to be bought at a given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
time. The difference between the estimated sales for the period and
the actual sales to date is the estimated sales to be made during the
remainder of the period. If from the stock on hand at a given date
is subtracted the estimated sales for the rest of the period, the
difference will be the estimated stock remaining on hand at the end
of the period, providing no more purchases are made. If this amount
is less than the amount of stock planned to be on hand at the end
of the period, the department is “open-to-buy” to the amount of the
difference. If the estimated amount on hand at the end of the period
is more than the planned inventory for the end of the period, no
additional stock should be purchased, except of course to replenish
certain stocks which have become depleted and which it is necessary to
have on hand to meet the needs of customers. In calculating the stock
on hand at a given time, cognizance must be taken of stock in the
warehouse, in transit, and on order. A typical open-to-buy calculation
is shown below:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fontsize_110" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >

<p>This open-to-buy figure should be amended in the light of experience
with regard to the way in which actual sales are running as compared
with the estimated sales. If it is apparent that the sales are running
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
ahead of the estimate, the sales quota should be enlarged accordingly,
which will in turn increase the open-to-buy balance. A similar
adjustment should be made in the event that actual sales are not
keeping pace with the estimated quota.</p>

<p><b>The Stock Control Card.</b>—The problem of stock control is not
solved solely by a maintenance of buying quotas and limits. The
movement of individual commodities must be watched very closely. The
tying up of funds in large stocks of slow moving commodities may soon
use up the buying quota needed for faster moving commodities. To
maintain control over the movement of individual commodities, a record
called the “stock control card,” which is similar to the stock book,
is of great value in some lines. To other lines it will not be found
adaptable. It is not the purpose of this chapter to attempt to lay
down specific methods adaptable to all situations but only to discuss
basic principles and to illustrate them by methods found applicable to
certain situations. The control card illustrated in <a href="#FORM_43">Form 43</a>
is one used in a retail shoe store.</p>

<p>On the form shown as <a href="#FORM_43">Form 43</a>, Style, Bought From,
Description, and Material, are self-explanatory. On the line below,
cost is shown in the first column, size in the next, and the month with
days along the rest of the line follows. Horizontally are entered on
the dates shown the quantities of stock received (Rec’d), on hand (O.
H.), sold (Sold), and on order (O. O.).</p>

<p>According to the form, on August 1 there were on hand 19 pairs
of shoes, size 9, and 11 pairs of size 9½. During that week, on
consecutive days, 3, 4, 3, 6, 2 pairs of size 9 shoes were sold, of
which 2 pairs (circled) were returned on the 4th and 5th; and 2, 2, 1,
3, 4 pairs of size 9½ shoes were sold, of which 1 pair was returned but
again sold on the 5th.</p>

<p>On the first day of the following week 24 pairs of each size which had
been ordered on the 2d of August were received. Upon their receipt the
O. O. (on order) figures were inclosed in circles. On that day also the
O. H. (on hand) figure was placed in its proper place in the size 9
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
group. All of size 9½ had been sold during the first week of August and
there was of course no figure to be entered there.</p>

<p>The record is continued by daily postings of sales and by a weekly
posting or entering of the stock on hand. Orders are entered on the day
they are placed.</p>

<p>With such a stock record a perpetual inventory is maintained and
control over the movement of merchandise is secured.</p>

<p><b>Problems Connected with the Merchandise Inventory.</b>—Proper
accounting for merchandise at the time of inventory-taking and the
close of the fiscal period requires a consideration of the following
points:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goods in Transit.</span> It may happen that
certain goods have been ordered during the period, and that the invoice
has been received but that the goods themselves are still in transit.
The question whether or not such goods shall be included in the
inventory may be viewed from different angles, as follows:</p>

<p>1. If the goods have been paid for in advance, they have
undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span> been
entered on the books as a charge to Purchases. If this is the case,
the goods in transit must of course be included in the inventory as
if actually received.</p>

<p>2. If the goods are still in transit but have not been paid for,
it is customary not to charge them to Purchases until they arrive.
If not charged to Purchases, or other similar account, they must not
be included in the inventory. However, theoretically, this method
is incorrect. The fact that the goods have been ordered and are now
in transit makes the business liable for their purchase price, and
although not actually received, in reality they form a part of the
asset merchandise. It is true that until the goods are received,
inspected, and accepted, the purchaser has the privilege of refusing
them if they are not as ordered, but this privilege is exercised only
in exceptional cases. Generally speaking, therefore, it is better
to consider such goods as a completed purchase, include them in the
inventory and credit the vendor for the amount of his invoice. Instead
of being charged to Purchases account, such goods may be charged to
Purchase Commitments which will better indicate their status.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goods Received but not yet Booked.</span>
In concerns where a separate shipping and receiving department is
maintained, it may happen that the goods received by this department
are not immediately transferred to stock or storage, in which case they
may not have been taken up on the books. At the end of the period it is
important to see that all such goods are properly recorded as purchased
and are included in the inventory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goods In or Out on Consignment.</span> Still
another problem in connection with the inventory has to do with goods
which do not belong to the business because they have been consigned to
it for sale on account of their owner. Inward consigned goods must not
be included in the inventory, if taken into stock, it is very important
that they be so marked as easily to distinguish them from the regular
stock.</p>

<p>Similarly, if goods are out on consignment to another market, they
still belong to the business and must not be overlooked at inventory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
time. If the proper record is made at the time the goods are shipped,
as will be explained in <a href="#Page_433">Chapter XLVIII</a>, the
memorandum accounts on the ledger will call attention to them. In some
concerns all such goods are entered as sales at the time of shipment.
If at the end of the period part of these consigned goods are still
unsold and in the hands of agents, they should be deducted from the
sales for the period and included in the inventory at full cost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goods for Future Delivery.</span> Goods sold
for future delivery are best handled at inventory time in the manner
suggested in <a href="#Page_433">Chapter XLVII</a>, even if they are
set aside ready for delivery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goods Ready for Current Delivery.</span>
Finally, goods sold for current shipment but delayed in delivery on
account of congestion in the service or for some other cause are best
treated as sales and excluded from the inventory.</p>

<p><b>Importance of the Sales Department.</b>—Of the major departments
into which business activities are commonly classified, the selling
department ranks first in point of relative importance. Regardless
of the efficiency secured in the other branches, regardless of the
economy in buying and the excellence of administration, the life of
a business largely depends upon the results obtained by the selling
division. Since the sales department plays such an important part in
the development of the business, it is evident that the accounting
and financial problems connected with sales should be given careful
attention and should be handled by the most scientific and up-to-date
methods.</p>

<p>As before stated, one of the most important principles of modern
accounting is that the system by which the records are to be kept must
be planned in advance. The modern accountant must first know the kind
of information that is desired and he then can classify the accounts so
that the information may be obtained from the ledger or other records
at any time, with the least possible effort.</p>

<p><b>Basis for Sales Classification.</b>—The majority of enterprises at
the present time deal in a number of commodities, the kind, quality,
and grades of which are of such variety that careful classification
is imperative. Formerly all goods sold were classed together under
a single title “Merchandise,” with the result that no detailed
information concerning the sale of particular goods, qualities, and
grades was available and the manager or proprietor was unable to study
the movement of specific classes of commodities.</p>

<p>Applying the principle of classification to sales, the basis for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
classification depends on the character of the business and the nature
of the goods sold. Where the commodities dealt in are of such variety
that it is impracticable to have a separate account for each kind, a
more general grouping by classes may be necessary. Where the concern
manufactures some of its commodities and buys the remainder in the open
market, an analysis of sales on the basis of “own” product and “other”
product may be wanted. Sales may be classified also on the basis of
the sales contract, as cash, credit, instalment, sales to branches,
consignment sales, approval sales, etc. Accounting problems in
connection with these various types of classification will be treated
in the present chapter.</p>

<p><b>Principles Governing Analysis in Books of Original Entry.</b>—It is
evident that the kind of classification shown in the ledger determines
the journal analysis. That is to say, the analysis in books of original
entry, and therefore their columnar ruling, always depends upon the way
in which the accounts are classified and grouped in the ledger.</p>

<p>The various types of analyses, both in journals and in ledgers, make
use of either (or both) horizontal or vertical distribution. In most
forms or records, except in banking and allied institutions, the
generally accepted practice is to reserve vertical distribution for
showing chronological sequence, and horizontal distribution for any
other kind of classification. The reason for this lies in the fact
that the time basis requires practically unlimited space and the
requirement can be met only by vertical distribution, consecutive pages
being considered as the continuation of preceding pages. Horizontal
distribution, on the other hand, is limited to the width of the page.</p>

<p>By reference to <a href="#Page_366">Chapter XLI</a>, “Handling the Cash,”
it will be noted that for the purpose of horizontal classification the sheet
contains a number of money columns, each headed by an individual class title,
and that each item is first entered in the general column and then extended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
to one of the subsidiary columns. This serves as a check against error,
since it is evident that the total of the general column must be equal
to the sum of the totals of the other columns, thus furnishing a fair
though not complete proof that the extensions have been made correctly.
All books where analytical processes are involved should provide some
kind of internal check. The student should refer to Chapters <a href="#Page_139">XVIII</a>,
<a href="#Page_147">XIX</a> and <a href="#Page_162">XX</a>, where form
of analytic journals and explanation of them were given.</p>

<p><b>Use of the Sales Ticket in Analysis.</b>—Since the sales invoice
or ticket is the basis for entry and analysis in the sales journal,
it must give on its face the information necessary for making the
analysis. In accordance with the basis of classification used, it
should show the department number, the kind of goods sold, whether
for cash or credit, etc. The use of invoices with printed department
numbers and of different colors for cash, charge, and C.O.D. sales, aid
in making the record effective.</p>

<p>In a business of any size, the entry on the main sales journal only
shows the total for the day’s sales. The sales tickets lend themselves
easily to grouping, and therefore a day’s sales may be analyzed by
sorting and grouping the sales tickets. Under any method of this sort,
of course, each ticket must be used for the record of only one class of
goods. Thus the totals of each of these sorted groups may be entered
in the sales journal at the end of the day. Besides furnishing the
totals for each group of sales, the individual tickets are used also
for the purpose of posting the sales to the accounts of the particular
customers.</p>

<p>After use in these various ways the tickets are filed away in
binders for reference. Thus, the main books are freed of a mass of
comparatively unimportant detail, to which it is necessary to refer
only in rare cases.</p>

<p><b>Analyzing Sales Returns.</b>—Attention should be called to the
necessity of analyzing returned sales, allowances, and rebates, on the
same basis as sales. Provision should also be made for a separate sales
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
returns journal since the ordinary journal does not lend itself
economically to an analyzed record of that kind.</p>

<p><b>Purchases and Returned Purchases.</b>—It has been pointed out that
the basis of classification of sales in the ledger determines the
analysis in the sales journal. The same classification should also be
applied to purchases, returned purchases, and inventories, because only
in this way is it possible to determine the profit from the different
classes of merchandise.</p>

<p>Similarly, all inward costs, such as duty, freight, insurance,
handling, etc., which enter into the cost of goods sold must be
analyzed on the same basis and apportioned to each group on some
equitable basis. Because of practical difficulties, however, this
analysis or apportionment usually is not made upon the first entry
of these items on the records, but a distribution on a more or less
arbitrary basis is made at the close of the period. In a large concern
where very detailed information as to results is desired, an analysis
of many other expenses and costs applicable to each sales group is
made. Such a distribution of expense, however, leads into the field of
cost accounting which is beyond the scope of the present discussion.</p>

<p><b>The Handling of Cash Sales.</b>—Where an analysis by kind of
commodity is unnecessary, a simple method of booking cash sales is
by entry in a “Sales” column provided in the cash book, the total
of which is posted to the credit of “Sales” in the ledger. Under
this method, cash sales need not be entered in the sales journal. In
previous chapters where the functions of the subsidiary journals were
discussed, the practice of entering a cash sale in both cash book and
sales journal was advised, so that the summaries of each may show true
totals for those groups of business activities. However, this principle
is often departed from and the method just described for booking cash
sales is followed. Where an analysis of the sales is desired, the
practical difficulty of providing analysis columns in the cash book for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
the cash sales in addition to analysis columns in the sales journal for
the sales on account gives added weight to the principle stated.</p>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to distinguish between cash and charge
sales, thus requiring two accounts, the “Sales on Account” and the
“Cash Sales,” to show the total sales for the period. This is easily
accomplished by the use in the sales journal of the “On Account” and
“Cash” columns whose totals furnish the amounts for posting to the two
ledger accounts. Even were it desired to have two sales accounts, the
cash and charge, for each department, the necessary information can be
secured by providing in the sales journal two columns, a cash and a
charge for each department and posting their totals to the two sales
accounts carried for each.</p>

<p>A more complicated problem arises when it is desired to keep an account
to show the total cash sales of <i>all</i> departments and at the
same time to keep one sales account for each department, in which
will be recorded both cash and charge sales. The information can be
placed on the ledger, but not without destroying the usual meaning
of the Cash Sales account. The purpose is accomplished by providing
the sales journal with two total or general columns—in addition to
the departmental columns—one for charge and one for cash sales, and
by carrying a Cash Sales column in the cash book. The items in the
Cash Sales column in the sales journal are distributed to the proper
analytic columns for classification. At the end of the period the
totals of these analytic columns (which include both cash and charge
sales items) are posted to the credit of the proper departmental
accounts in the ledger. The total of the Cash Sales column in the
sales journal, however, is posted to the <i>debit</i> of Cash Sales in
the ledger, which will be offset by a corresponding credit item from
the Cash Sales column in the cash book. These two totals should agree
provided the books are completely posted.</p>

<p><b>Sales to Branches.</b>—Sales to branches are made on different
bases in different concerns. Sometimes such sales are charged to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
branch office at cost, sometimes at full selling price, and sometimes
at a fictitious figure. The first method is theoretically the best, but
is not always desirable because head offices frequently prefer to keep
their branches ignorant of cost prices. For this reason such sales are
frequently charged to the branch office at the regular selling price.
By this method, however, the books of the head office record the goods
as if actually sold, while in reality they have been merely transferred
to a branch office. Consequently, the books show a profit which is not
yet earned. In order to correct this, it is necessary at the end of
the period to make an adjustment entry covering all goods still in the
possession of the branch office unsold at that time. By billing the
goods at a fictitious figure the branch is also kept in ignorance as to
real profits, but proper adjustment should be made at the close of the
period for the reason explained just above.</p>

<p>Whichever method is followed, sales to branches should always be kept
separate from the regular sales accounts. Where shipments of goods
to branches are frequent and a matter of regular routine, a branch
shipments journal similar to the sales journal should be provided;
otherwise a special column in the sales journal will suffice. The
total of such sales should be credited to a Branch Shipments, Branch
Consignments, or some similar account, so as not to confuse these
transactions with regular sales. The subject of accounting for both
domestic and foreign branches is treated in Volume II.</p>

<p><b>Consignment Sales.</b>—Consignment sales—which in some respects
resemble branch sales—should also be recorded separately from regular
sales. This is so because the title to goods out on consignment is
still vested in the consignor and no element of profit appears in the
transaction until an actual sale is made. However, in the case of an
<i>occasional</i> consignee as distinguished from a factor who deals
regularly in consigned goods, it has usually been held that the title
has passed to the consignee so far as the consignee’s dealings with all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
except the consignor are concerned. Only in this way can the interests
of innocent third parties be adequately protected.</p>

<p>The accounting for consignments is treated in <a href="#Page_447">Chapter XLVIII</a>.</p>

<p><b>Instalment Sales.</b>—The instalment sale should be treated in a
different manner from regular sales because of certain special features
connected with it. The chief characteristic of the instalment sale is
the probability of the goods coming back into the seller’s possession
through forfeiture because of non-payment of instalments, the profit on
the transaction of course being affected thereby.</p>

<p>The sale of goods with the privilege of payment in instalments is a
well-recognized custom in certain lines, particularly in the furniture,
piano, book subscription, and similar businesses. To protect the
seller, the sale contract almost invariably contains a clause to the
effect that title to the goods shall remain in the seller until final
payment has been made, that failure to pay any instalment when due
shall result in the cancellation of the contract, and that in such case
the goods shall be returned to the seller. Experience with this class
of sales shows that a large number of contracts are forfeited with
or without return of the goods. Where the goods are returned, there
is frequently a large loss through depreciation, the returned goods
having to be treated as second-hand. In some instances, to enforce
return of the goods might entail greater expense than loss of the
goods themselves. These are, of course, questions of business policy
rather than of accounting, although the results shown by the accounting
department enter into their settlement.</p>

<p><b>Accounting for Instalment Sales.</b>—The accounting for sales under
the instalment plan is not different from accounting for other sales.
They are, in their first record, charged to the customer and credited
to Sales or various departmental sales accounts. If the goods are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
forfeited and returned, the record is to Returned Sales for the debit
and the customer is credited for the unpaid instalment. Whatever profit
or loss there may be on the transaction will be shown in the Profit and
Loss account when the inventory is taken and the returned goods are
appraised. If the customer fails to pay his instalments but does not
return the goods, the loss is one from bad debts.</p>

<p><b>Separation of Instalment from Regular Sales Records.</b>—Where both
instalment and regular sales are made, as is usually the case since
few concerns limit their activities entirely to the instalment method,
it is best to keep a separate instalment ledger with a controlling
account, called “Instalment Accounts Receivable” or “Instalment
Contracts.” The two classes of customers should be kept separate
because of the greater liability to loss in the one class than in the
other. Before profits for the period can be correctly determined, it
is necessary to estimate the probable loss on contracts closed during
the period. In the balance sheet separate showing should be made of the
reserve for this class of accounts receivable and the reserve for the
other class. The estimated loss on the instalment accounts is of course
a figure based upon experience, but a conservative policy requires that
the amount should be fairly liberal.</p>

<p><b>Delinquency Records.</b>—Forfeiture of contracts is not
usually enforced upon first failure to pay an instalment, but such
delinquencies should be brought to the attention of the management
and particularly of the credit and collection department. Delinquency
may even be recorded in the books by transfer from the Instalment
Accounts Receivable to a “Delinquent Instalment” account. This makes
an up-to-date analysis of the Instalment Receivable account and so
furnishes a better basis for estimating losses from bad debts than
where no separation is made.</p>

<p><b>Chief Considerations in Handling Instalment Sales.</b>—From the
accounting standpoint, the chief question is that of making the estimate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
for loss from uncollectible accounts. From the standpoint of financial
management, instalment sales present the problems of passing on credits
before taking the risks and afterwards of pushing collections so as
to prevent, whenever possible, forfeiture and consequent loss. It is
not purposed to treat of these phases here, for which the student is
referred to standard works on credits and collections.</p>

<p><b>Sales for Future Delivery.</b>—From a legal point of view,
the receipt of a purchase order gives rise to certain rights and
obligations enforceable at law between buyer and seller. While the
seller may not be able to enforce specific performance of the contract,
yet he is entitled to the damage incurred through nonperformance.
Every merchant knows, however, that the cost of securing the remedy
is usually higher than the resulting gain and, furthermore, an action
against the customer frequently causes the loss of his trade.</p>

<p>Sales for future delivery do not always materialize, since either the
buyer or the seller may wish to cancel the contract. A conservative
policy therefore demands that the sale be not booked until delivery is
made. The order, however, may be received in one fiscal period and the
sale be credited to the period in which the goods are delivered, while
the major part of the expenses in connection with the sale may have
been incurred during the period in which the order was received. The
current period then is charged with the expenses but does not receive
the credit to which it seems entitled. Therefore, the portion of the
selling expense incurred during the period in which the order was
secured should be deferred to the period which receives the credit for
the sale.</p>

<p>This policy should be followed even when the goods covered by the
future sale are set aside specifically for future delivery and the sale
should not be booked until delivery is made. At inventory time such
goods should be included at cost, with the deferred expense charge as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
above. Occasionally an unscrupulous merchant in need of cash will bill
such goods and discount the invoice; but for the reason given above
such goods should not be charged to the customer until delivery is made.</p>

<p><b>Department Store Sales.</b>—As indicated above, in a department
store sales are usually classified by departments. The two classes
of sales tickets, cash and credit, are sorted by departments and the
totals are entered daily either in the sales journal or on the loose
sales sheets which, when filed in a binder, make up the sales journal.
At the end of the month the journal is posted to the various department
sales accounts. Each day the entries on the sales journal are checked
against the cashier’s record of cash received from sales and the
bookkeeper’s record of charges posted to customers.</p>

<p><b>C. O. D. Sales.</b>—For this class of sales the credit is booked in
the usual way but the debit is made to a C.O.D. account. The packages
are charged on the shipping department’s memorandum records to the
various delivery men who are credited with the collections turned in.
These collections form the basis for the credit to the C.O.D. account
on the ledger. Any balance in the C.O.D. account shows the amount of
the undelivered goods still on hand in the shipping department or on
the wagons and therefore charged against the various drivers.</p>

<p><b>Approval Sales.</b>—In many lines of business approval sales are
common. Merchandising concerns frequently send goods to customers for
trial and inspection, with the privilege of return if the goods prove
unsatisfactory. Publishing houses often send out books—both single
volumes and whole sets—with a few days’ examination privilege. This
class of business is often handled in a rather unsystematic fashion.
Usually it is impossible to discriminate among prospective customers,
since offers of this kind must be made to all alike. Consequently the
privilege is often abused by the unscrupulous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span></p>

<p><b>Accounting for Approval Sales.</b>—This abuse creates the problem
of a correct method of handling approval sales. The difficulty is
rather one of organization and administration than of accounting
procedure; the record-keeping presents no new difficulties and under
certain conditions may be likened to the methods of recording outward
consigned goods. In no sense are such transactions to be regarded as
sales and handled in the regular sales records, thereby showing a
profit not yet earned. The correct method, both from an accounting and
a legal viewpoint, is to keep a memorandum record of approval sales
similar to that made for consignments.</p>

<p>Unlike consignments, however, the price shown in the invoice is the
actual selling price of the goods, and the sale if consummated is
treated as a regular sale, no effort being made to keep the profit
or loss on approval sales separate from the profit on regular sale
transactions.</p>

<p>In the retail trade the prevailing practice in handling approval sales
is to enter the charge to the customer’s account when the goods are
sent out and to credit the account for all returns. In this way the
books keep record of all goods out on approval and provide an adequate
check against lost or misplaced goods.</p>

<p>When transactions of this kind are large in number, subsidiary books
devoted exclusively to their record may be kept.</p>

<p><b>Tickler File Method of Handling Approval Sales.</b>—Approval sales
transactions must usually be completed within a comparatively short
space of time, either by acceptance or by return of the goods, and in
such cases a shorter method of recording them is followed. The sales
tickets or invoices covering approval sales are made with some kind of
a distinctive mark—color of paper, title, etc.—to allow their easy
separation from the regular sales tickets. These tickets are kept in
a temporary tickler file in the order of the expiration dates of the
approval period. If the sale is consummated, the ticket bearing a stamp
to that effect is sent through for record as a regular cash or credit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
sale. If the goods are returned, the ticket may be filed as a part of
that particular customer’s record; in this way a cumulative record is
secured which would in some cases give an interesting commentary on
human nature. If the customer is one who makes it his or her practice
to buy on approval to secure the free use of nice wares for an evening
or for some social function, the record would show it. A rigorous
and unrelenting collection and follow-up system, supplemented by a
full credit and information record, is the only safeguard against
unscrupulous customers and oftentimes even this proves inadequate.</p>

<p>At inventory time all goods out on approval as shown by the approval
sales file must be included in the inventory at inventory price, for
the goods are still owned by the firm. As stated above, they must never
be treated as sales.</p>

<p><b>The Bill and Charge System.</b>—By this name is known the method
of writing up the customer’s bill and using it as the basis for the
charge to his account. The system is operated somewhat as follows: The
duplicate sales tickets go to the auditing department, where they are
first sorted by departments to secure the departmental analysis of the
sales, and then re-sorted according to customers. Thus, if a customer
has made purchases in more than one department, the tickets covering
all his purchases are brought together. Each customer’s monthly bill
or statement of account is started at the beginning of the month on a
folded billhead perforated at the fold, the duplicate or under portion
usually being somewhat wider, with loose-leaf binder punchings. On
these bill and duplicate blanks the charges for the day are entered
from the sorted sales tickets. This work is usually done on a billing
machine with carbon roll or with carbon paper insertion.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the total amount of the charges entered on all
monthly statements is either found by means of an adding machine or is
indicated by the “tally strip” of the billing machine. This total must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
of course be equal to the aggregate amount of all sales tickets for
that day, thereby proving the work of the billing clerks.</p>

<p>Customers’ bills after entry each day may either be passed on to the
bookkeepers who charge each customer’s account with the day’s total
purchases as shown by the bill, or the bills are returned to the file
until used again for subsequent purchases. In such case the bookkeeper
enters the total monthly charge to the customer’s account, only once a
month.</p>

<p>Returned goods and allowances are also entered on these customers’
bills, but in a separate column or on another portion of the sheet.</p>

<p>The total charges entered on these statements must check against the
total credit sales for the month, thus proving the additions of the
bills.</p>

<p>At the end of the month the bill is torn from its duplicate and is
passed to the bookkeepers. They enter the previous month’s balance,
if there is one, and the current payments on account, and extend the
amount now due. After the bills or statements have been mailed to the
customers, the duplicate bills are filed away, being virtually the
detail of the ledger account, for use in case of dispute.</p>

<p>This method of handling credit sales provides a ready means of getting
the bills out on time, of assuring agreement between the ledger
accounts and the bills, of freeing the ledger accounts of unnecessary
detail, and of checking the total billings against the total sales
tickets.</p>

<p><b>Salesmen’s Commissions and Efficiency Records.</b>—Salesmen are
often paid a commission in addition to salaries. Where the commission
is based on the amount of sales, the sales ticket is made use of as the
source of information for computing the commissions earned. To this
end the tickets are sorted according to salesmen, and a record sheet,
either separate or as an adjunct to the sales journal sheets, is filled
in with each salesman’s total sales for the day. These totals should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
prove against the salesman’s record in the back of his book of sales
tickets. At the end of the month his total sales are shown by his
record sheet and his commission is determined therefrom. Of course, the
total for all salesmen as shown by these sheets must equal the total
sales for the period.</p>

<p>If the commission, often known as “spifs” or “P. M.’s,” is allowed
only on certain classes of sales in order to encourage the movement of
old stock, each sales ticket should indicate the amount of premium or
commission due, so that a record can be made without the necessity of
depending on the records of the individual salesmen.</p>

<p>Salesmen’s records besides being used for the particular purpose of
computing commission, or bonuses due them, serve a wider object in
that they contain fairly complete and reliable data in regard to the
value and efficiency of individual salesmen. For this reason such
records should be kept at all times, no matter whether a commission or
bonus system is operated or not. Whenever an increase in a salesman’s
salary is considered or when the sales force is to be decreased in
number, these efficiency records are a valuable aid in making the right
decision.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLVIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">CONSIGNMENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Definition.</b>—When goods are shipped to another party to be
sold by him for account of the shipper, the transaction is called a
“consignment.” In its original sense, to “consign” means to seal,
sign, mark, or label in a formal way. In commerce this term has come
to signify goods sent for sale through another party. Usually such
goods are marked or labeled to distinguish them from those belonging
to the consignee. The owner or sender is designated “the consignor”;
the selling or receiving party “the consignee.” Sometimes the word
“shipment” is used by the consignor to designate the goods sent away
for sale, and the word “consignment” to indicate the goods received by
the consignee. Differentiation on this basis is convenient, but the
terms “consignments-out” and “consignments-in” are more descriptive and
will be used here.</p>

<p><b>Legal Status.</b>—Before treating the accounts required to record
consignment transactions, it is well to understand the legal relations
between the consignor and consignee. The general law of bailments and
of agency applies in a restricted sense to consignments. A bailment is
defined as, “A delivery of goods for the execution of a special object,
beneficial to the bailor, the bailee or both, upon a contract expressed
or implied, to carry out this object, and dispose of the property in
conformity with the purpose of the trust.” Agency is the term used
to indicate the legal relation between a principal and the agent who
represents him. A person appointing another to act for him in his
dealings with third parties is called the principal. The one appointed
to represent the principal is the agent. A bailment is therefore a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
special class of agency transactions with particular rules governing
the safe-keeping of the goods of the principal in the possession of the
agent. In the case of a consignment, the consignor is the principal and
the consignee the agent. The relation of the consignee to the consignor
as regards the care to be exercised in handling the consignor’s goods
is a bailment relationship.</p>

<p><b>The Broker.</b>—A broker, although he acts as agent, usually is
not a consignee. He acts “as a middleman, bringing people together to
trade, or trading for them in the private purchase or sale of any kind
of property, which property, ordinarily, is not in his possession.”
The charge for his service is usually in the form of a commission,
sometimes called brokerage. There are several classes of brokers, named
according to the kind of commodity they deal in; for instance, there is
the exchange broker, the note broker, the insurance broker, the stock
broker, the real estate broker, the merchandise broker, etc.</p>

<p><b>The Factor.</b>—Other types of middlemen are the manufacturer’s
agent, who is a broker or sales agent, effecting sales usually by means
of samples; and the factor or commission merchant who actually handles
and sells the goods of his principal. The chief distinction between the
broker and the factor is that the broker sells goods in the name and
for the account of his principal, but the goods are delivered directly
to the purchaser by the principal, who also collects the account;
whereas the factor has the goods of his principal in his possession and
sells them either in his own name or in the name of his principal.</p>

<p>The factor may operate under a specific contract with his principal,
covering a single consignment, or under a general contract governing
all consignment transactions between the two parties. Again, there
may be no formal contract between them, in which case the law sets
up a contract relationship based on trade usage and customs in any
particular line. Where the factor operates under a specific or general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
contract, certain points may arise which are not provided for in such
contract, and on these points trade custom governs.</p>

<p><b>Duties of the Factor.</b>—Barring specific instructions, the factor
may conduct the consignment transactions for his principal on the same
basis and in the same general way as he would conduct them were the
goods his own. In other words, he is expected to exercise the same care
in the handling of consignment goods as he employs in handling his own
property. In selling goods consigned to him he may extend credit to the
buyer if it is the custom in that particular line to do so, and he must
exercise due care as to the rating of the customer. He must push his
collections with ordinary diligence. He may warrant the goods sold if
that is customary. He can give good title to goods sold, and this title
may even be better than the one possessed by the owner of the goods. A
bona fide purchaser who does not know the principal is protected in a
sale made by a factor even if the factor exceeded his authority.</p>

<p><b>Factor Must Protect Goods.</b>—So long as any part of the
principal’s goods are unsold and in the possession of the factor, he
must protect and safeguard them. He is not liable, however, for damage
from forces or conditions over which he has no control. The degree of
diligence required of him largely depends on the nature of the goods.
What would be considered due diligence in one case, might be construed
as gross neglect in the case of more valuable or perishable goods.</p>

<p><b>Consignments to be Kept Separate.</b>—It is a fundamental
requirement and of the very essence of the factor relationship, that
the principal’s goods must be kept distinct from all other goods in
the factor’s possession. This applies not only to the consigned goods
as such, but also to the assets received by the factor upon the sale
of such goods—as cash, accounts and notes receivable, etc. To satisfy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
this latter requirement it is usually held that actual separation is
not necessary, but that it is sufficient to record these properties in
such a manner that they can always be separated if the need arises. The
principal’s properties are held in trust for him by the factor but are
subject to the legitimate claims of the factor.</p>

<p><b>Expenses Charged against Consignment.</b>—Barring specific
instructions to the contrary, the factor may incur certain expenses
necessary to safeguard the interest of his principal and to effect the
sale of his goods. These include such items as freight, insurance,
duty, handling charges, allowances and rebates to customers for
unsatisfactory goods, etc. All these are proper charges against the
consignment, i.e., against the principal.</p>

<p><b>Factor’s Lien on Consigned Goods.</b>—For any legitimate expenses
incurred and for any payments made the principal in advance of the
settlement date, the factor has a lien on the consigned goods. It has
been held in some cases that the factor has the right to sell the
goods in satisfaction of the lien, and if the proceeds of the sale are
not sufficient to satisfy the factor’s claims against the principal,
the latter is liable for the amount of the deficiency. The factor’s
commission from the principal is also protected by this lien and, if
necessary, the factor may apply part or all the proceeds of the sale
toward the payment of his commission. A lien, of course, is binding
only so long as the goods are in the factor’s possession.</p>

<p><b>Account Sales.</b>—Upon completion of his service the factor must
make a strict accounting of his transactions to the principal. In
case of dispute he can be required to open to the inspection of the
principal his records covering the consignment dealings. The usual
method of settlement is by means of an “account sales” rendered by the
factor to his principal. The account sales is a summarized statement
of all transactions connected with a particular consignment. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
constitutes the formal accounting for the consignment transaction. It
must show the amount or quantity of goods received, the sales made, and
the expenses incurred, the balance being the amount due the principal.
This amount may be either remitted or credited to the principal’s
account, according to the contract between them. The usual form of
account sales is shown in <a href="#FORM_44">Form 44</a>.</p>

<p>Goods may be billed to the factor at cost, at the current market price,
or at some fictitious figure. This billing price does not enter into
the accounting of the factor at all. It is the selling price of the
factor which is the basis of income against which expenses are charged.
The principal may indicate a selling price for his goods but this
serves merely as a guide to the factor as to the price desired. If,
however, the principal gives specific instruction as to sale price, the
agent must govern himself accordingly.</p>

  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 44. Account Sales</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
<b>Compensation of Factor.</b>—The factor usually receives his
compensation on a commission basis—so many per cent of the sales he
makes. When the contract makes specific provision for it, he may sell
the goods at a higher price than that fixed by the principal and retain
part or all of the excess as compensation.</p>

<p><b>“Del Credere” Agency.</b>—Where a factor sells on credit, the
accounts belong to the principal and any loss through uncollectible
accounts is borne by the latter. Sometimes the factor guarantees the
collection of all accounts; in this case he is known as a “del credere”
agent and receives additional compensation for assuming this risk. Such
a guarantee really amounts to a sale of the accounts to the factor.</p>

<p><b>Advantages of Consignments.</b>—While the practice of consignment
trading is not so prevalent now as it was formerly, it still prevails
in some lines and under certain conditions. Shippers to the produce
market frequently consign their goods to city brokers whom they
instruct to take advantage of the prices prevailing in the open
market, and in this way they may realize higher prices than when they
sell outright to the wholesaler. The consignment shipment has another
advantage to the shipper, in that the title to the goods remains
vested in him; hence a consignment is safer than a sale on credit
to a consignee unless his rating is satisfactory. The practice of
consignment trading is of sufficient importance to require a discussion
of the accounting principles involved. These will be given first from
the viewpoint of the consignor, and then from that of the consignee.</p>

<p><b>The Consignor’s Entries.</b>—The chief interest of the consignor
lies in the net outcome of each sale in order to determine the
advantage, if any, of the consignment policy over a straight sale
policy. To accomplish this, he must keep a separate account with each
consignment, either on the general ledger or on a subsidiary ledger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
with a total summary account on the general ledger. When the consignor
sends the goods, whether they be invoiced at cost, sale, or some other
price, entry should not be made direct to his Sales account, for no
sale has been made as yet. He has merely placed some of his stock in
another market, being still the owner of the goods.</p>

<p><b>Two Methods of Entering Sales on Consignor’s Books.</b>—There are
two ways of recording correctly a consignment on the consignor’s books
at the time the goods are sent. According to one method, the goods are
transferred from Purchases to another merchandise account, having for
its title the word “Consignment,” followed usually by the name of the
consignee and the number of the particular consignment made to him, as
“Consignment No. 4, J. B. Arscott.” To this account are charged not
only the goods at cost price but also all expenses of the transfer, as
freight, duty, insurance, etc., the corresponding credits being to Cash
or to Purchases as the case may require. This is the only record made,
until the account sales is received from the factor. Upon the receipt
of the account sales, the Consignment account may either be credited
with the net proceeds or be charged with the expenses and credited
with the gross sales, as shown in the account sales. If the money is
remitted by the factor the Cash account is debited; otherwise the
factor’s account is debited for the net proceeds.</p>

<p>The Consignment account is now a true proprietorship account, showing
income on the one side and cost of that income on the other side. The
difference is either a profit or a loss according as the balance is a
credit or a debit. In order readily to distinguish complete consignment
transactions from those only partially completed, it is best to close
the completed accounts by a transfer of the balance to a “Consignments
Profit and Loss” account where it is held until the close of a fiscal
period, at which time it is carried to the general profit and loss.</p>

<p>The second method of recording the transaction at the time of sending
the consignment is to set up two memorandum accounts, Consignment and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
Consignment-Out (or Consignment Sales), debiting and crediting these
respectively with the invoiced value of the consigned goods. In this
case there is no credit to the Purchases account as under the first
method given above. Any expenses incurred are charged to the regular
expense accounts instead of to the Consignment account. For handling
the consignment shipments no special books are required, original entry
being in the general journal. If there are many such transactions,
however, a special column in the sales journal or a special
consignments-out journal is desirable.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the account sales, the regular sales account is
credited either with the net or with the gross proceeds; and the other
accounts—as cash, the consignee, and expenses—are debited according
to the manner of booking as explained in connection with the first
method.</p>

<p>The two memorandum accounts, having served their purpose of calling
attention to the fact that some goods have been sent to other markets
for sale, should now be canceled by a reversing entry, since the goods
have been sold and the record of their sale has been made in the
regular sales account. The effect of this second method is to merge
consignment and regular sales transactions into one record, making
impossible a separate showing of the profit or loss on consignments.
The particular method to be used, therefore, will depend upon the
information desired.</p>

<p><b>Consignor’s Inventory.</b>—If the consignor’s fiscal period
closes before an account sales in full settlement is received, and if
accounting treatment is by the first method, the goods shown in the
Consignment account are included in the inventory of goods on hand and
so represented in the balance sheet. If the second method is used,
the Consignment and Consignment-Out accounts are both omitted from
the balance sheet, being merely canceling memorandum entries, and the
unsold portion of the consigned goods are included in the inventory.
In determining the value of consigned goods, the expenses incurred in
sending the goods to the new market may properly be included as a part
of the cost.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span></p>

<p><b>The Consignee’s Entries—First Method.</b>—Two methods of making
entries on the consignee’s books at the time of receipt of goods are
used. In the first method, two memorandum accounts, Consignments and
Consignments-In, are set up, Consignments being debited for the billed
value of the goods received, and Consignments-In being credited for the
same item. The purpose of these accounts is merely to set up on the
general books a reminder of the transaction.</p>

<p>A third account, John Doe, Principal, is used for current record.
This account is charged with the expenses incurred in connection
with the consignment and is credited with the sales made therefrom;
it is charged also with the consignee’s commission. The balance of
the account is, at the completion of the sale, the amount due the
consignor, Doe. When this is paid, the account is closed by a debit to
John Doe, Principal, and a credit to Cash or Notes Payable. So long
as the balance is unpaid, the account, John Doe, Principal, shows
the factor’s liability to his principal. This is a special kind of
liability, that of a trustee, which is indicated by the inclusion of
the word “Principal” in the account title; in case of insolvency a
portion of the assets equal to the balance of John Doe, Principal’s
account belongs to John Doe and, unless merged beyond possibility of
separation, must be so treated. When the sale has been completed, the
memorandum accounts, Consignments and Consignments-In, are canceled
against each other, having served their purpose.</p>

<p><b>The Consignee’s Entries—Second Method.</b>—Under the second
method, instead of an entry on the general books, the receipt of the
goods is recorded in a blotter or memorandum book of consignments
received, in which are entered all essential data, covering the name
of consignor, quantity, price, legend or distinguishing marks, etc.
Expenses incurred are charged to John Doe, Consignment account on the
general books, and sales are credited to the same account. Settlement
is made as with John Doe, Principal, as explained above, except that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
when the balance is not paid it frequently is transferred to a simple
John Doe personal account, where so far as account title is concerned
it loses its character as a trust account and is merged with all other
creditors.</p>

<p><b>Consignments Must Have Distinguishing Marks.</b>—In making his
sales from the various consignments, the factor must be careful to
record them in a way to distinguish the goods taken from different
consignments. This is particularly true of sales on account, for if the
accounts prove uncollectible it is important to know to which lot the
loss must be charged. This is accomplished by recording the consignment
legend or mark with the sale.</p>

<p><b>Factor’s Books at Close of Fiscal Period.</b>—When the factor’s
books are closed, the commissions earned to date on consignment
sales, whether the entire consignment transaction is fully or only
partially completed, should be taken into account. Commissions earned
on completed consignments should already be on the books as debits to
the various principals’ accounts and credits to “Commissions Earned.”
The commissions on incomplete consignments are brought on the books
by entry of the accrued income in the Commissions Earned account, the
amount being based on the sales made from the incompleted consignments
during the period. The accounts with these incomplete consignments may
show either debit or credit balances. If a debit balance is shown, the
account is an asset representing the consignee’s claim against his
principal for expenses incurred in excess of sales made. If a credit
balance is shown, the account represents a trust liability as above.
At a closing time the memorandum accounts of incomplete transactions
should be adjusted to their present inventory values.</p>

<p><b>Consignee’s Inventory.</b>—Just as the consignor must be careful to
include in his inventory all goods out on consignment, so the consignee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
must be equally careful to exclude from his inventory all goods of his
principal’s still unsold and in his possession.</p>

<p><b>Illustrative Entries on Consignor’s and Consignee’s Books.</b>—An
illustration of a simple consignment transaction from the viewpoint
of both consignor and consignee is given below. It is assumed that a
consignment transaction takes place between J. J. Querles and I. M.
Factor as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> Querles sends to Factor
to be sold on his account goods amounting at cost to $1,250. He pays
cartage $15, and insurance $25; while Factor pays freight, duty, and
cartage amounting to $52.50. Factor makes sales of $1,600 and renders
an account sales showing also allowances to customers of $27.30, a 5%
commission charge and 1% for guaranteeing collection of all accounts,
and the net proceeds credited.</p>

be made according to the information desired by the principal. Where
consignment transactions are a side line, the record is usually kept by
the first method which shows the profit or the loss on each transaction
and thus furnishes valuable information for executives. This is
sometimes called the occasional consignment theory or method. Where the
consignment transaction is the usual method of effecting sales, the
second method illustrated above is generally to be followed, because by
this method all consignment transactions are properly included in the
regular sales and expense records.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">ADVENTURE SALES</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Adventure Transactions.</b>—Before the day of easy transportation
and communication between markets, adventure or venture undertakings
were quite common. The inherent willingness of men to take a chance,
and the desire to speculate, often led to the fitting out of cargoes
of merchandise for sale in distant ports and the equipping of trading
expeditions into unknown regions. Many dangers had to be met, the
hazards and risks being great. Success attended many adventurers, and
many also met with failure. Even today this method of seeking a market
has its allurements.</p>

<p><b>Single and Joint Ventures.</b>—Adventures are of two kinds, single
and joint. The single adventure is merely an outward consignment
by a single proprietor and is treated in accounting as such, i.e.,
it is charged with all its costs and credited with its returns,
the balance being either a profit or a loss. The joint venture is
accounted for on the same principle, although the procedure may be
much more complicated. A joint venture account may be defined as the
record of “commercial transactions of a particular kind, usually of a
temporary nature, entered into jointly by several parties who combine
together for the purpose, contribute the capital and the services,
as may be arranged, and agree to share the losses or profits in
certain proportions.” Speculation in stocks, the chartering of a ship
for a particular purpose, a particular voyage, or a fixed period of
time—these are some lines of present-day joint venture endeavor.</p>

<p><b>Relations between Parties.</b>—From the legal point of view, the
combination under a joint venture is a special partnership, i.e., one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
entered into for the accomplishment of a special purpose, the several
parties to it having control, as in a partnership, and sharing profits
and losses either according to contract or, in its absence, equally.
Usually, in a joint venture one of the parties or an outside agent is
entrusted with the entire enterprise.</p>

<p><b>Accounting for the Joint Venture.</b>—Accounting for the joint
transactions is comparatively easy. If the undertaking is simple, one
account for each such joint undertaking, viz., “Joint Venture,” will
suffice. This account will be carried on the records of the regular
business of each party to the venture. The account is debited with the
costs of the venture and credited with the returns from it.</p>

<p>If the enterprise is more complicated, it may be required to set up a
number of separate accounts, or even a separate set of records, but
the summary or clearing account for these will still exhibit costs set
over against returns. If the partners are all in the same city and have
access to the records, one set of accounts is all that is necessary.
Where the partners are in different places, each should keep a record
of all transactions as reported by the manager of the venture. Since
the manager reports all transactions to each of the parties, the “Joint
Venture” accounts as kept by the different partners will all be the same.</p>

<p>The other accounts affected by the joint transactions will either be
the same or reciprocal. Upon the inception of the venture, some of
the partners having contributed cash, others merchandise, still other
facilities, services, etc., the Joint Venture account is charged with
all contributions and each partner is credited. If the venture is
managed by one of the partners, instead of a credit to his own personal
account, his cash or merchandise account will receive the credit for
his contribution. If the managing partner desires to separate his
investment in the joint venture from his investment in his regular
business, he will set up a Joint Venture Investment account to which
the amount of his contribution to the joint venture will be transferred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
from his regular capital account. Expenses incurred are charged to the
joint account and credited to the partner paying them. All sales made
and collected are credited to the joint account and charged to the
partner retaining the money.</p>

<p><b>Interest Allowances and Charges.</b>—Because some partners may
have made larger contributions than others, the agreement may provide
that interest be credited the partners on their contributions. On the
other hand it frequently happens that one or some of the partners
have the use of the moneys received from joint sales until date of
settlement of the venture, and the agreement may provide that interest
shall be charged to those retaining the collected funds. This can be
accomplished by charging the joint account and crediting the partners
with interest from the dates of their contributions to the date of
settlement, and by charging the partners retaining joint funds and
crediting the joint account from the date when the funds come into
their possession until the settlement date. A salary or a commission
may be allowed the managing partner or partners. This also is a charge
to the joint account and a credit to the partner.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Profits.</b>—After all transactions have been
completed and all charges and credits made, the joint account for
each venture will show by its balance the net profit or loss. This
is distributed among the partners in agreed ratio, or in equal ratio
in the absence of agreement. After this is done, only the partners’
accounts remain, some with debit and others with credit balances. The
managing partner should collect the debit balances and remit to those
with credit balances, thus making a complete settlement of the joint
undertaking.</p>

<p>Should the fiscal period of any of the partners close during the term
of the venture, conservatism would generally require that his own
accounts do not show a profit on the sales made to date, on the theory
that losses on the incomplete portion may wipe out any profits on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
completed portion. This is because the joint undertaking is considered
as a whole and inseparable transaction and not as composed of numerous
separate sales. The element of risk is always an important factor in
undertakings of this sort. However, there might be circumstances under
which the taking of at least a partial profit could be justified.
Assuming that no profit is taken, the joint account becomes a balance
sheet account at closing, asset or liability according as costs have
been more or less than the sales as on the date of closing.</p>

<p><b>Joint Venture Accounts Illustrated.</b>—An illustration will bring
out the salient points in the above discussion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> A, B, and C enter a joint
venture to Mexico, with C as manager. A and C contribute merchandise
valued at $5,000 and $8,000 respectively, and B $11,000 cash for the
purchase of additional merchandise. C is to receive 3% commission on
sales. C pays freight, duty, and insurance of $890 from his own cash,
and buys merchandise with B’s contribution. He makes sales, according
to reports sent by him to A and B, aggregating $30,000, and holds the
amount in his possession one month till settlement. The investment
period is six months. Interest at 6% is to be credited to partners on
their original investments and is to be charged to C on the $30,000
held by him for one month.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
A, B, and C share profits in the ratio of their original contributions.
Settlement is made by C in cash.</p>

<p>The following entries show the record of the above
transactions on B’s and C’s books.</p>

$30,000 joint funds used by him for one month is not recorded as an
interest cost of the venture, but is charged to C’s regular Interest

<p>The accounts on each partner’s books with his copartners are not
ordinary asset and liability accounts but are more of the nature
of capital accounts and might be entitled “A, Contribution,” “B,
Contribution,” etc. The records of the joint venture comprise a group
of accounts which constitute a unit within themselves, showing the
partnership relation existing among the several parties from the
inception of the partnership to its liquidation.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">ACCOUNTS CURRENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Definition.</b>—An account current in its broadest sense is an
account of current transactions. In a technical sense, it is an open
personal account, one with an outstanding balance. Frequently accounts
are allowed to run on between two persons, recording transaction
after transaction with partial or full settlement at times but with
no intention of closing the account. A principal may have constant
dealings with his agent or representative, making periodical payments
on account or making remittances to be used as needed by the agent.
The agent may make purchases for the account of his principal, paying
the bill out of his own funds. He may use in his own transactions
any surplus funds of the principal in his possession. An account
showing transactions of these various kinds is an account current.
The customers’ accounts in brokerage houses and the accounts between
banks—banks and their correspondents—are other examples of accounts current.</p>

<p><b>Interest on Balances.</b>—In handling accounts current between
banks and in brokerage houses, it is the practice to charge the account
with interest on the debit balances and to credit it with interest on
the credit balances. It was formerly the practice in some lines of
trade to charge interest on all overdue customers’ accounts. Frequently
today invoices carry a statement to that effect, although the policy is
not often enforced through fear of loss of patronage.</p>

<p><b>Joint Venture Accounts.</b>—In the case of joint ventures discussed
in <a href="#Page_460">Chapter XLIX</a>, a condition analogous to this was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
mentioned where the joint account was charged and the contributing
partners’ accounts were credited with interest, while the managing
partner was charged and the joint account credited with interest on all
joint funds retained in his possession.</p>

<p><b>Partners’ Accounts and the Account Current.</b>—Occasionally,
also, in partnership adjustments at the close of a fiscal period, the
agreement may require the business, i.e., the partnership, to allow
each partner credit for interest on his investments and charge him with
interest on his withdrawals. Each partner’s account is treated very
much as an account current of the business when such adjustments are
prescribed.</p>

<p><b>Illustration of Account Current.</b>—Thus, while the old account
current as formerly understood and applied to the ordinary customer
and creditor relationship is now very seldom encountered, the
principle of it is met with frequently enough to demand explanation
and illustration. No special form is necessary for the stating of an
account current; the interest calculations on the various balances can
be made outside the account and only the net result be embodied in the
account. A form of account is shown in <a href="#FORM_45">Form 45</a>,
however, which exhibits all necessary data on its face. Take the
following account on which 5% interest is to be charged and allowed:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
<b>Adjusting the Account Current.</b>—Adjustment of such accounts is
usually made periodically. Referring to the illustration shown in <a href="#FORM_45">Form 45</a>,
the interest calculation is made counting the exact number of days
from each “date of value” to and including December 31. Interest is
figured, for the sake of ease of calculation, on a 360-day basis. A
365-day basis would be more accurate and this is often done on current
accounts between banks. The “date of value” is the date from which
interest may be equitably charged or allowed. For example, in the above
account, the credit for merchandise purchased on July 4, but with a
credit allowance of 30 days, may not equitably be allowed till 30 days
thereafter, or August 3. On the debit side, the note for $1,500 dated
August 11, at 60 days with no interest, cannot be equitably counted
until it comes due, i.e., on October 10. Similarly, the “date of value”
on December 10, for the goods returned of the transaction of December
4, must be reckoned as of the same date as the original transaction,
for only a portion of the full credit set up is allowed to remain.</p>

<p>In the above problem, the credit interest exceeds the debit by $35.80.
This amount is therefore brought as an additional credit into the
account. The account as now adjusted will be sent to B. I. Perkins
for his verification. When formally approved, or if no objection is
made to it after a reasonable length of time, the account is balanced
and it becomes now what is termed an adjusted account. This periodic
adjustment makes possible the localization of disagreements and their
settlement while the facts are still fresh in mind. Its effect,
however, is to produce a slight compounding of interest unless the
balance is immediately settled.</p>

<p>Another method of making the interest calculation is on the basis of
the balance of the account after each transaction and the length of
time it remains unchanged, i.e., until the next transaction changes the
balance. This method follows somewhat the method illustrated in
<a href="#Page_290">Chapter XXXIII</a> for division of partners’
profits on the basis of the amount of the investment and the length
of time invested; but under this method it is not possible to make
so condensed and apparent a statement of account as by the method
illustrated in full above.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the “date of value” may fall beyond the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
settlement date, as where the term of credit throws the time of
payment far enough ahead that payment cannot be demanded till after a
periodic settlement time. The effect of such a condition is to reverse
the interest charge for the period beyond the settlement date to an
interest credit, or vice versa. The method of averaging accounts
or equation of payments, as it is sometimes called, may be used to
advantage here. Explanation and illustration of this method are given
in <a href="#Page_485">Chapter LII</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Bank Account an Account Current.</b>—The bank’s account with a
depositor is a good example of the account current. Except by special
agreement, the allowance of interest is not customary. Periodically,
the depositor’s pass-book is balanced or a statement of his account
is rendered by the bank. When the balanced pass-book, with canceled
checks, is returned to the depositor, or when the statement of account
is rendered by the bank, the record kept by the depositor—as shown
by his check book stubs or by the bank column in his cash book—will
not usually show the same balance as that indicated by the bank’s
statement, and adjustment or reconciliation is necessary to check the
accuracy of the statement. In <a href="#Page_366">Chapter XLI</a>,
regarding the handling of cash, the policy was recommended of
depositing all receipts and paying only by check. A cash book kept
under that plan, making use of a net cash column on both sides, does
not need an additional column for the bank record because everything
shown in the net cash columns has either been deposited in the bank
or paid out by check. The cash book balance, therefore, should be the
same as the bank’s balance. If the record of the bank account is kept
only on the check book stubs or interleaves, this balance should be the
same as the bank’s. But however kept, there will almost invariably be
a few outstanding checks which the depositor’s cash book or check book
shows as having been issued, but which have not been presented to the
bank for payment at the time the statement of account is rendered and
which therefore are not included in the statement. This brings about a
difference which must be reconciled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span></p>

<p><b>Reconciliation of Bank Balance.</b>—Two methods of reconciliation
are used. The one brings the bank’s balance into agreement with that
of the depositor; the other starts with the depositor’s balance and
brings it into agreement with that of the bank. The first step in
the reconciliation is to discover which of the checks issued by the
depositor have not been paid by the bank. This is done by arranging
the returned checks in numerical sequence and comparing these with the
depositor’s record of checks issued. Usually the total of these few
unpaid checks will be equal to the discrepancy between the two records,
and so will reconcile them.</p>

<p>The following problem is given to illustrate the above discussion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem</span></b>. On March 20, at the
close of the day, the bank’s statement showed a balance of $1,525.14.

checks were outstanding: No. 529B, $214.50; 542B, $379.60; 557B,
$119.40; 581B, $75.20; and 992A, $132.25.</p>

<b>Other Reconciliation Factors.</b>—Oftentimes other items than those
shown must be taken into consideration when reconciliation is made.
Where several bank accounts are kept and a check register—in addition
to the cash book—is used to keep record of the accounts with the
various banks, it may happen that checks drawn on one bank are wrongly
charged to another; that checks drawn, or deposits made one day, are
not credited until the next; that certain drafts deposited with the
bank for collection are not credited to the depositor’s account until
collection is made, whereas the depositor debited the bank at the
time of the deposit; again it may be that the item of bank’s charges
for collection has not yet been recorded; or that interest on deposit
balances has not been credited, etc. All such items must be considered
when reconciliation is made. Where there are many of these adjustment
items to be taken account of, it may be necessary to list them in
formal schedules under such heads as:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">1. Bank charges, we do not credit.</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Bank credits, we do not charge.</li>
<li class="isub2">3. We charge, bank does not credit.</li>
<li class="isub2">4. We credit, bank does not charge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of transactions bringing about the above debits and credits
are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. Protest fees charged against the depositor’s
account, of which he has not been notified.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Interest on bank balance credited by bank
before the depositor is notified.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. Deposits made and charged to bank but not
yet credited by bank or credited in error to some other depositor’s
account.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. Checks drawn but not yet presented to the bank
for payment.</p>
</div>

<p>When the first method of reconciliation is used, items (1) and (3) must
be added to the bank’s balance and items (2) and (4) must be subtracted
from it in order to arrive at the cash book balance. The following
problem will illustrate this:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><b><span class="smcap">Problem.</span></b> In the bank’s statement

<p>It will be seen that neither the cash book balance nor the bank
balance is a correct statement of the cash available for checking. The
depositor, in order to find this amount, will have to take account of
the figures given by the bank for items he has not known about. His
checking balance in the above problem is ascertained as follows:</p>

<p>There is not usually so much difficulty in reconciling the bank
account; but where several bank accounts are maintained, it is easy to
misplace debits and credits and a formal statement of reconciliation
should always be made and kept as a part of the record. This
reconciliation should be made every time a statement is received from
the bank. The frequency of asking for a statement of account from
the bank depends somewhat upon the volume of transactions handled
through the bank, but it should be secured at least every month and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
particularly whenever formal statements of profit and loss and balance
sheet of the depositor are made up.</p>

<p><b>Reconciliation Statement a Permanent Record.</b>—The reconciliation
statement should be made as a permanent record. A customary place of
record is on the check stub of the same date. Where a check register
is used, it should be made a part of the record there. Occasionally it
is incorporated in the cash book. Wherever made it should be easily
available for proof at a subsequent period. When reconciliation is to
be made as of a past date, i.e., at a time subsequent to the date on
which reconciliation is desired, the bank’s cancellation date on the
returned checks must be used to determine what checks were outstanding
on that date.</p>

<p><b>Reconciling Other Accounts.</b>—Occasionally the dealings between
two firms located at a distance from each other may be such that items
are in transit one or both ways at the time when statement of account
is rendered. If this is the case, the methods of reconciliation applied
above to the bank account may have to be used before agreement or
comparison of the two records can be effected.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">BALANCING METHODS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The “Fool-Proof” Trial Balance.</b>—Double-entry bookkeeping
is never satisfied with anything short of absolute proof of the
mathematical accuracy of the work. Often such proof is very difficult
to secure. There has not yet been devised—and in the nature of things,
never will be—any so-called royal road to the trial balance. Yet one
often sees claims put forth that there is no longer any need for trial
balance troubles. The use of certain methods, which are disclosed only
upon payment of fees in proportion to the advantages claimed for them,
makes it possible, according to their devisers, to take a trial balance
within an incredibly short time or to do away with trial balances
altogether. As a matter of fact, satisfactory results can be obtained
only by habits of accuracy and by proving the work done wherever
possible. Some methods found useful in searching stubborn errors will
be explained in this chapter.</p>

<p><b>Ledger Analysis.</b>—By ledger analysis is meant an analysis of
postings classified according to the books of original entry, i.e., on
the basis of all journals whose record is transferred to the ledger.
The process of making such an analysis is somewhat as follows: The
ledger must be gone through carefully and for each account the last
debit and credit figures which entered into the last <i>correct</i>
trial balance must be marked distinctly so as not to be included in the
analysis. If the analysis is for an interim period, the first debit
and credit items belonging to the next period should be marked in a
similar way, as shown in the illustration (<a href="#FORM_46">Form 46</a>).
This must be done very carefully as the “date” is not always a safe guide.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
The use of subsidiary journals with one summary posting to offset many
detailed contra postings and inaccurate dating of the summary posting,
often make the “date” an uncertain guide. Care should therefore be
exercised so that the points marked include a complete, i.e., a debit
and credit, posting of every journal.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_46" src="images/i_478.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="510" />
  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 46. Account Marked for Analysis</p>
</div>

<p><b>Procedure of Analysis.</b>—The content of each account between the
marked points is now analyzed according to the journals from which the
postings have been made. Analysis paper, with debit and credit columns
headed for each journal, may be used for this purpose. All debits in
the account posted from the journal are entered in the debit journal
column of the analysis sheet, all cash debits in the debit cash column,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
all sales journal debits in the debit sales journal column, etc.
Similarly, the credit postings in the account are entered in the proper
credit columns of the analysis sheet. Each item in the account should
be checked or otherwise marked when transferred to the analysis sheet.
Illustration of the analysis sheet is given in <a href="#FORM_47">Form 47</a>.</p>

<p>When the various accounts have thus been analyzed, there should remain
no unchecked items in the period analyzed, unless there have been
transfers between accounts made directly on the face of the ledger. If
this has been the practice, an additional heading with debit and credit
columns, entitled “Ledger Transfers,” should be set up on the analysis
sheet. <i>Every</i> account in the ledger is analyzed in the same way.</p>

<p><b>The Analysis Sheet.</b>—It will be noticed in <a href="#FORM_46">Form 46</a>
that only the period between the two diagonal marks \ and / is under
analysis. Accounts which have been closed but are within the period
under analysis must, of course, be included. When all accounts have
been analyzed, the columns of the analysis sheet are footed. For each
journal the footings of the debit and credit columns should be equal.
A difference will indicate that there is an error in the postings from
that particular journal. In this way the error is localized and only
these postings need to be checked individually.</p>

<p>The cash book columns in the analysis sheet (<a href="#FORM_47">Form 47</a>)
may need some explanation. If no Cash account is kept on the ledger, the balance
of the cash book for the period will have to be entered on the analysis
sheet before equality of the cash columns will be shown. With the
exception of the items transferred to the analysis sheet from the Cash
account—where a Cash account is carried in the ledger—all items in
the cash debit column of the analysis sheet represent, in the cash
book, credits to certain accounts, and those in its credit column
represent debits to certain accounts. The entries to the cash analysis
column from the ledger Cash account, showing on its debit cash receipts
and on its credit cash disbursements, must bring about the equilibrium.
The column total, however, will not represent cash receipts and cash
disbursements respectively, but the total of each column will be the
sum of both receipts and disbursements; whereas the totals of the other
columns are equal to the totals of the corresponding journals for the
period. This is brought about by the fact that the two cash columns on
the analysis sheet really cover two independent journals, viz., the
cash receipts and the cash disbursements journals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FORM_47" src="images/i_480.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="357" />
  <p class="f120 space-below1">Form 47. Ledger Analysis Sheet</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
Agreement between the debit and credit totals of corresponding columns
is proof of equilibrium in the postings from that book; but unless
these column totals also equal the total of the corresponding journal,
there is evidence of the omission from the ledger, both on the debit
and on the credit side, of items recorded in the journal. Thus the
ledger analysis serves also as a check against omissions; but when used
for that purpose, account must be taken of duplicate entries in the
various journals, such as cash sales entered both in the cash and sales
journals but posted only from one of them.</p>

<p><b>Use of Ledger Analysis.</b>—All that is claimed for the ledger
analysis is that it localizes the error, if it is an error in posting,
and so makes the work of searching for it less haphazard and renders
unnecessary a checking of all postings in the ledger. All the means
previously explained should be exhausted before this method is used.
If the previous trial balance, i.e., the one at the beginning of the
analysis period, is correct and the ledger analysis shows no errors in
posting, then certainly the trial balance for the end of the analysis
period must balance. If not, the error is an error on the face of the
ledger and its computations must be proved.</p>

<p><b>The Slip or Reverse Posting System.</b>—As indicated before, it is
better to post carefully and accurately in the first place than to hunt
for errors afterwards. A method of proving daily postings known as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
slip or reverse posting system is used with success in many places.
Formal slips of any convenient width and length are provided, one for
the debit and one for the credit of each book from which postings are
made. The debit slips may be easily distinguished from the credit slips
by the use of different colors. The debit slips are ruled only with
money columns and each slip bears the title of its journal. Reverse
posting is made on the slip from the items posted to the ledger. Thus,
when posting the debits from the general journal, the general journal
debit slip is carried conveniently on the right of the ledger and entry
of each debit posting to the ledger is made <i>from the ledger</i> to
the slip. When all journal debit postings have been made, the reverse
posting slip is totaled and must agree with the total of the journal
debit column for the items posted. Similarly, the journal credits are
posted, reverse posted, and proved. The debit postings must equal the
credit postings and thus proof is secured of the equilibrium of the
ledger. Each journal is posted, reverse posted, and proved in a similar
way. The bookkeeper is, in this way, sure of the correctness of his
work day by day. Oftentimes monthly recapitulation of these reverse
posting slips are made and preserved as part of the business records.
It will be seen that this method is identical with the ledger analysis
method explained above but applied at the time of making the posting
instead of at the close of the period.</p>

<p><b>Check Figures in Posting.</b>—The use of the check figures 9
and 11 in the verification of the arithmetic processes of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division was referred to earlier.
Other odd numbers, such as 13, 17, and 19, are less frequently
employed. The number 11 gives perhaps the most satisfactory results
from the standpoints of ease of application and accuracy of results.
Its use in the verification of postings is somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>An additional column similar to the folio column should be provided
in all the books for the check numbers. As an amount is posted to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
ledger the bookkeeper should determine the check number from the item
as it is written in the ledger—not from the journal item—and enter it
in the check column in both ledger and journal. When postings from the
journal are complete, the journal is totaled and the check figure for
its sum found. If this agrees with the sum of the check figure column
in the journal, posting is presumably correct. If the two items do not
agree, the check number for each amount in the journal debit column
should be proved. Inasmuch as the check number used was obtained from
the ledger amount, a wrong check number for the journal amount would
indicate a wrong posting which should now be turned to and corrected.</p>

<p>The check numbers in the ledger accounts are used only for verifying
account totals and balances and may even be carried into the trial
balance for proving it. Practice in the use of any check number soon
develops accuracy and speed and makes the method easy of application
and commendable wherever the work must be proved day by day as completed.</p>

<p><b>Errors in Columnar Books and Controlling Accounts.</b>—These are
frequent sources of trouble unless handled with care. In the chapter on
columnar books, it was laid down as a basic principle that <i>all</i>
items appearing in the general amount column should be entered in
some analysis column, i.e., analysis columns should be provided for
distribution of <i>all</i> items. This makes proof of distribution
possible and establishes formal equilibrium of the book so that errors
in posting are not so likely to occur.</p>

<p>Care must be exercised in posting the discount columns of the cash book
to the proper sides of the respective accounts.</p>

<p>In the use of controlling accounts, where a special column is not
provided, as for Accounts Receivable on the credit side of the cash
book, posting of the item should be made both to the individual account
and also to the controlling account.</p>

<p><b>Trial Balance Adjustment Account.</b>—Where error creeps into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
ledger and seems impossible of detection at a monthly trial balance
period, the device of forcing a balance is sometimes used by setting up
an account called “Trial Balance Adjustment,” “Error in Trial Balance,”
or some other similar title. To this is charged or credited the amount
of the difference in the trial balance. It is a temporary makeshift,
a method of holding the item in suspense until the error is located.
Needless to say, the inclusion of such an account does not improve the
appearance of a trial balance, but may be countenanced as a temporary
expedient.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">SOME APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST<br />
AND PROPORTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>The Nature of Interest.</b>—Interest may be defined as the charge
made for the use of money. Sprague defines it as the increase in
principal due to the lapse of time. The ethics of the practice of
charging interest was questioned by the ancient world and not fully
conceded as right until modern times. Various economic theories have
been evolved to explain the true character of interest. Whatever they
may be, interest as a commercial phenomenon is thoroughly established
and countenanced by the law, although in many states an exorbitant
interest charge is declared to be usury.</p>

<p><b>Commercial Interest.</b>—Commercial interest, so-called, usually
contains an element in addition to the time-charge for the use of
money. That element may be: (1) in the nature of a premium for
insurance against the risk of losing the money loaned; or (2) where
capital in some fixed form is loaned, in the nature of an allowance or
additional charge to cover the shrinkage in the asset loaned due to
wear and tear.</p>

<p><b>Simple and Compound Interest.</b>—As to its method of calculation,
interest may be simple or compound. Simple or single interest is
figured on the single base known as the principal, the only other
element being the length of time. Compound interest periodically adds
the unpaid interest to the previous principal, and so secures interest
not only on the original principal but on all unpaid interest as well.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span></p>

<p>In accounting both kinds of interest are recorded under the common
title Interest. Some applications of the interest principle to certain
special accounts will be discussed.</p>

<p><b>Equation of Payments.</b>—The practice of averaging accounts is
occasionally met with at the present time in American business. In
proceedings in bankruptcy, all claims against the bankrupt on open or
running account comprising several items, when filed with the trustee,
must show the average due date of the items if interest is to be
secured on the overdue amounts.</p>

<p>The problem involved may best be shown by an example. The following
account appears on A’s books, showing charges against B:</p>

<p>If B does not settle the various amounts as they come due, A is
deprived of the use of his money longer than contemplated in the sale
contract. In justice to him, interest on the overdue amounts ought to
be allowed. If B should pay any of the amounts earlier than the terms
of sale require, he should be allowed a discount, i.e., a rebate equal
to the interest for the time of prepayment. Further, shortly after the
last purchase on June 2 at 60 days, amounting to $2,000, B may desire
to settle his entire account, taking his discount for prepayment on the
$2,000 and allowing A interest on the overdue amounts. If the date of
settlement is fixed, the amount necessary for an equitable settlement
may be determined by the method used for the account current in the
previous chapter.</p>

<p><b>Average Due Date.</b>—But B may want to know the date on which he
can settle equitably by paying the exact amount of the account without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
either paying interest on the overdue items or taking discount on the
$2,000. The problem involved is that of averaging or equating accounts.
The equated date, due date, or average date of payment are the terms
variously applied to the date of equitable settlement. If the account
has only debits or only credits, the equation is called a simple or
single equation or average; if it has both debits and credits, the
equation is called a compound or double equation.</p>

<p>In order to determine the equated date, an arbitrary one, called the
focal date, is taken for the purpose of computing the interest charges
and credits, and from that date the days of interest are counted
backwards or forwards according to the result arrived at through use
of the arbitrary date. Interest is calculated at an arbitrary rate,
usually 6% (100% per day is used by another method of calculation), and
in the case of compound equation the same rate must be used on both
debits and credits.</p>

<p>To illustrate the method of calculation for the simple equation and the
interest principle involved, the account above cited will be equated.
In order that the expired time between the focal date and each date
of value may be easily computed, the last day of the previous year is
taken as the focal date. Interest is at 6%.</p>

<p>This calculation shows that theoretically, had the various transactions
been under contemplation on December 31, the focal date, payment of the
total $2,650 could equitably have been made with a discount of $80.28.
The interest (or discount) on $2,650 for 1 day is 44⅙ cents. A discount
amounting to $80.28 can therefore be demanded on $2,650 only as the
result of an offer to prepay 182 days (80.28 ÷ .44⅙ = 182) before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
payments are equitably due. Hence, payment of $2,650 without discount
would settle the account equitably 182 days after the focal date, or on
July 1. That this is true can easily be proved by using July 1 as the
settlement date and figuring as for a current account. It will be found
that interest on the overdue items on that date amounts to $10.42,
while the discount on the item not yet due amounts to $10.33; the
difference .09 not being a large enough fraction (9 ÷ 44⅙) to justify
payment one full day earlier.</p>

<p><b>The 100% Method.</b>—A short method of calculation may be used,
employing the 100% per day method. Any date may be taken as a focal
date, and very frequently the date of the first or last transaction
is used. In the illustration below, November 30 of the previous year
is taken as the focal date so that the expired time on each item is
immediately indicated by the <i>number</i> of the month and the day
in the “date of value” column. The use of the 100% per day method
makes the calculation of interest on each item a simple matter of
multiplication by time and amount, i.e., it reduces each amount to
a “day-dollars” figure, and on that basis one day’s interest on the
account total is equal to that total, and therefore the divisor in the
division made to determine the focal date is the amount of the account.
This greatly simplifies all the operations. Sometimes the expired time
is calculated by calendar months and days, converting fractions of a
month on a 30-day basis. The method is used in the illustration below,
where the problem shown above by the accurate interest method is solved
by the 100% method.</p>

<p>The “month-dollars” column divided by the “amount” column gives 6,
shown in the “equated date, months” column, with a remainder of 2,500.
This is reduced, by multiplication by 30, to day-dollars and carried
to that column, whose total, 80,100, is divided by 2,650, giving 30 as
shown in the “equated date, days” column. The equated date is therefore
June 30 (6/30). The one day’s difference between this and the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
method is accounted for because each calendar month is counted as 30 days.</p>

<p><b>Compound Equation.</b>—Where the account has both debits and
credits, the estimate is made similarly. Calculation of the month-
and day-dollars is made for each side separately. At this point the
totals on both sides are combined to find the balance of the account
and the balance of the discounts, and these two balances are used to
find the equated date. If the balance of the account is on the same
side as the balance of the discount, the equated date is forward from
the focal date because, if settlement were made on that date, the man
who owes the balance is entitled to the theoretical discount also. If
the balance of the account and the balance of interest are on different
sides, the count is backward from the focal date. The following account

<p class="space-above2">Dividing we get 1 month, 64 days, i.e., 3
months, 4 days. The balances being on opposite sides, the equated date
is 3 months, 4 days, backward from November 30 (11/30),
i.e., 11/30 - 3/4 = 8/26 or August 26. Equitable settlement
could therefore be made by interest-bearing note for $500, dated August
26, or by cash payment of $500 plus interest on $500 from August 26
until date of actual settlement, as would be the case had the account
been handled as an account current with adjustment as of August 26.</p>

<p><b>The Cash Balance.</b>—When an account has been equated, to
determine the cash sum which will be required for equitable settlement
on a given date subsequent to the equated date, the balance of the
account plus interest on that balance from the equated date to the date
of settlement will be the correct amount. This amount is technically
called the cash balance of the account. It is exactly the same as the
adjusted balance of an account current, and may be determined by such
adjustment of the account instead of by the method of equation of
payments just described.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span></p>

<p><b>Interest on Partial Payments.</b>—Under the heads of accounts
current and equation of payments, the question of partial payments
on open account has been treated. There remains to be discussed a
statement of the practices governing partial payments on notes. Two
methods of calculating are in use, the legal or United States method
and the so-called merchants’ method. The merchants’ method is used for
short-time notes and on any other kind by agreement. The method is
exactly similar to that of adjustment of current accounts. Interest is
charged on the face of the note from its date of issue till its due
date, and allowed on each partial payment from its date of payment till
the due date of the note. The difference between the sum of the face of
the note plus its interest and the partial payments plus their interest
accruals is, of course, the balance due.</p>

<p><b>United States Rule.</b>—The United States Supreme Court has
ordered the application of the partial payments somewhat differently.
The first partial payment must first be applied to the payment of
the accrued interest on the principal up to the date of the first
payment. Any excess shall be applied to a reduction of the principal.
Each succeeding payment is similarly applied first to cancellation of
accrued interest on each new principal and then to a reduction of the
principal. In case any payment is insufficient to meet the accrued
interest, the payment is held in reserve, the principal remaining
unchanged until a payment or payments are made which added to the
previously reserved payment or payments are sufficient to cancel
all interest accrued to that date. Any excess is used to retire the
principal.</p>

<p><b>Interest on Daily and Savings Bank Balances.</b>—In the handling of
balances between banks, interest on daily balances is usually figured
in the settlement. Calculation is on a 365-day basis in the larger
banks. Banks frequently allow large depositors a low rate of interest
on daily balances maintained above a certain fixed minimum. Take the
following account:

<p class="space-above2">In the above account interest is allowed on all
amounts above $1,000 at the rate of 2%. If settlement is periodical,
interest may be calculated on the total of the “interest base” column
for one day. Usually, however, if a monthly settlement basis is used,
the total minimum balance for the month is subtracted from the total
of the “balance” column, and the remainder is the interest base.
In savings banks no interest is allowed on amounts which have been
withdrawn during the interest period, regardless of how long the sum
may have been on deposit previous to date of withdrawal. There is no
uniform practice as to when deposits shall begin to draw interest, in
some banks at the beginning of the month after deposit, unless deposit
is made on the first day of the current month; in others, not until the
beginning of the next interest period. Great care must be exercised,
therefore, in handling deposit and withdrawal dates.</p>

<p><b>Bank and True Discount.</b>—Bank discount has been defined as the

<p>True discount is the difference between the face of a debt and its
present worth, meaning by present worth that sum of money which placed
at interest now will equal or be worth the face of the debt at maturity.</p>

<p class="no-indent">the fractional form being preferred. In accounting
it is often required to divide amounts in certain ratios, as when
profits must be apportioned among partners, when insurance, taxes, and
other expense charges must be distributed over departments, etc. This
is usually entitled “apportioning.” It is not necessary to illustrate
simple proportion, but a problem in “weighted proportion” will be given here.</p>

<p>Apportion an insurance charge of $1,000 over departments A, B, and C
according to the property values in those departments, taking account
of the fact that the rate on A is double that on B and C. The property
values are: A $10,000; B $15,000; C $35,000.</p>

<p>The proper basis for distribution cannot be found, as in simple
proportion, by an addition of the values in the departments. Before
addition, the value in A must be weighted by 2, i.e., doubled. This
gives a basis of $70,000 ($20,000 for A + $15,000 for B + $35,000 for
C = $70,000). Of the $1,000 insurance cost, department A will have to
bear <big>²⁰/₇₀</big>;&emsp;B <big>¹⁵/₇₀</big>; and&emsp;C <big>³⁵/₇₀</big>.
The charges will be therefore:</p>

<p><b>Apportioning Freight Charges.</b>—In-freight and cartage are
treated as additions to the cost of goods bought; consequently, at
inventory time it is necessary to add the correct amount of in-freight
to the cost of goods on hand. However, it is seldom possible to apply
the freight costs directly to each unit of product on hand and yet
theoretically this should be done. Usually the ratio of freight costs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
to the total amount of purchases during a given period is taken as the
basis for adding freight to the inventory. Thus, if that ratio has been
5% for the period, a commodity costing $100 would be valued at $105 for
the inventory. Thus the freight expense is deferred.</p>

<p>This usually is deemed sufficiently accurate for most purposes. Where
departmental records are kept, or where accurate factory costs are
required, a closer apportioning is sometimes necessary. The freight
classifications are such that the rates are not proportionate to the
<i>values</i> of the goods; but other factors such as weight, kind of
goods, method of crating, etc., all enter into the freight rate. Of
these, the only factor which is easily obtainable is the weight. A
distribution of freight on the basis of <i>value</i> and <i>weight</i>
has been suggested—a weighted proportion method of apportionment.
This, of course, requires an involved calculation which is usually
“shied” at by bookkeepers and is not necessary except where very
accurate and detailed costs are required.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SINGLE OR SIMPLE ENTRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Different Systems of Bookkeeping.</b>—Except in small enterprises,
the only satisfactory system of bookkeeping is double entry. The
system—or rather lack of system—known as single entry antedates
double entry and is met today occasionally, particularly in small
retail stores. It seems necessary, therefore, to give the student an
explanation of its main features.</p>

<p>An early writer defines bookkeeping as “the art of recording
mercantile transactions in a regular and systematic manner.“ In
further elucidation he says: “A merchant’s books should contain every
particular which relates to the affairs of the owner. They should
exhibit the state of all the branches of his business; the connection
of the various parts; the amount and success of the whole. They should
be so full and so well arranged as to afford a ready information
in every point for which they may be consulted.“ Single entry
hardly measures up to these requirements, but there are places and
circumstances where it gives results satisfactory enough. Bookkeeping
has had a development contemporaneous with industrial life. Only simple
records are needed so long as industries are simple, but with the
increasing complexity of industrial enterprise, previous methods become
inadequate.</p>

<p><b>Single Entry.</b>—Single entry may be defined as that method of
keeping records which sorts out and classifies debits and credits only
as they apply to persons, the proprietor included, and usually also to
cash. To justify the strict application of the term, a <i>system</i>
must needs keep record of <i>all</i> transactions. Methods—not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
systems—of single-entry account-keeping are sometimes met with which
do not make full record. The point of view of single entry is personal.
All features of the business not connected with persons are looked
upon as being under the direct hand of the owner and subject to his
control. But uncompleted transactions with persons, whether customers
or creditors, are not capable of such oversight without the aid of
individual, classified records. The necessity of safeguarding the cash
and keeping its flow under review makes the classified cash record an
almost universal feature of single entry. As a usual thing, therefore,
single entry is characterized by: (1) a record of all transactions; (2)
a debit and credit analysis applied only to persons and to cash; and
(3) a classified and grouped record, i.e., ledger record, only as to
persons and cash. It does not analyze every transaction in its relation
to the business as a whole. It has a single point of view, i.e., it
considers only persons and cash and makes entries accordingly. Hence,
its name.</p>

<p><b>Books Required and Methods of Record—The Journal.</b>—In a
single-entry system three books of account are necessary—the journal,
the cash book, and the ledger. The cash book records all cash
transactions, receipts and payments, classified as to persons but
otherwise in narrative form. The journal records all other transactions
following the same method. The ledger makes secondary record only
under the heads of customers, creditors, and proprietor. The journal
is the standard two-column journal, the first column being used as
an “items“ column, and the second for totals. A three-column journal
is advantageous, the first column being used for items and for all
unposted amounts, the second for debit postings, and the third for
credit postings. This aids in proving the ledger postings, as will
later be seen. Transactions affecting persons are recorded under those
persons’ names followed by “Dr.” or “Cr.,” according to the analysis of
the transaction. This is necessary since position does not show it, the
method of left and right position for debit and credit not being used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
in the single-entry journal. All other transactions are recorded in
narrative form, merely a memorandum being made of them.</p>

<p><b>Cash Book.</b>—The cash book is the same as for double entry,
receipts on the left and disbursements on the right-hand page or
column, according as a double- or single-page cash book is used. Where
the double page is used, one of the two columns on either side is
sometimes used for the exclusive extension of the amounts to be posted
to personal accounts. This facilitates posting, since these are the
only amounts which are to be transferred to the ledger.</p>

<p><b>Ledger.</b>—The single-entry ledger is the same as the double-entry
and uses the debit and credit principle of double entry. As stated
above, accounts are kept only with persons, including the proprietor.
It is seen, therefore, that single-entry books make a record of
<i>all</i> transactions but fail to analyze all those transactions in
their relations to one another and in their effects upon the business.</p>

<p><b>Single Entry as Adapted to Modern Needs.</b>—Recognizing the value
of the analysis secured by double entry but overestimating the work
required to make the record, some concerns have developed single-entry
systems through use of subsidiary records and columnar books, from
which they derive very full information for management purposes. A
sales journal gives volume of sales, a purchase journal shows the
amount of goods purchased, and analytic columns in the cash book show
the main sources of receipts and their amounts, and the main classes
of expenditures and their amounts. A bill book is used for recording
notes receivable and payable, and inventory books for scheduling all
kinds of property, assets and liabilities. All of these make a system
approaching the double entry in completeness of detailed information,
but one which lacks the fundamental principle on which the double entry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
rests, viz., an equality of debits and credits brought about by a
classified analysis of every transaction into its debit and credit
elements at the time of first entry on the books. It does not tie
together the whole into a mathematically provable system.</p>

<p>Since the advent of double entry there have always been strong
adherents to the single-entry method. An early writer, William Perry,
presented in 1777 a treatise on bookkeeping by either method. Most
small enterprises, even if they keep their records by the single-entry
method in the beginning, usually adopt the double-entry system as
their business increases, realizing that the latter furnishes better
accounting control than is obtainable under simple entry.</p>

<p><b>Debits and Credits.</b>—To one who knows the double-entry method,
single-entry bookkeeping presents few difficulties. Debit and credit
as applied to personal accounts are usually of easy determination and
are exactly the same as in double entry. The debits and credits for
cash are based on the same principles in both systems. The method of
writing them in the books of original entry was sufficiently indicated
where those books were explained. Posting is done just as in double
entry. With regard to all work upon single-entry books, there is always
a temptation to do slovenly, inaccurate work because the system does
not provide internal proof as the double-entry system does. Thus, where
rebates have been allowed, only the net amount received may be shown in
the cash book with explanation that the payment is in full of account.
After this amount is posted to the customer’s account, the item does
not fully offset the original debit and it is necessary to make a note
in the ledger to the effect that the item is fully settled. The same
thing holds true for creditors’ accounts. Of course, this is not good
bookkeeping whether practiced in single or double entry.</p>

<p><b>The Proprietor’s Account.</b>—The handling of the proprietor’s
account under single entry is very similar to that under double entry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
The proprietor’s capital account shows the original investment on the
credit side; his personal account, if kept separately, is debited
with his withdrawals, whether in merchandise or cash. Inasmuch as the
single-entry ledger does not show the profit or loss, the manner of
handling the proprietor’s account at closing is somewhat different.
The profit, as determined by the method shown a little later, may be
brought directly and without journal entry from the statement of profit
and loss into the proprietor’s capital account so that this account
will show the true net worth of the business as at that time. The
personal account is simply ruled off after its figures have been used
in determining profit.</p>

<p><b>Proof of Posting.</b>—The only proof of work possible under single
entry is a checking of the secondary record against the original. A
trial balance of the ledger cannot be taken. A schedule or list of
account balances may be prepared and debit and credit totals of the
list made. This compared with a similar list prepared at the close of
the last period will show the changes that have taken place during the
current period. A list of the debits and credits to personal accounts
in books of original entry for this period must check against the
net change shown by the above comparison. Virtually this amounts to
a second posting of the items, and if the two postings agree, the
presumption is that the ledger is correct. The use of the “personal”
posting column for the cash book as explained above, and of similar
columns in sales and purchase journals, makes possible a much easier
debit and credit summary of the books of original entry if some proof
of posting is desired.</p>

<p><b>Profit and Loss.</b>—Inasmuch as many of the factors affecting
the net worth have not been analyzed in making the original entry, no
detailed showing of profit and loss, as understood under double entry,
can be made. It is, of course, possible to go back over the books and
make such an analysis, but this would result practically in rewriting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
the books on a double-entry basis. Single entry, therefore, has
recourse to another method which is characterized by a complete
inventory-taking and appraisal. It is sometimes called the “asset and
liability method” as explained in the following sections.</p>

<p><b>Inventory and Appraisal.</b>—A physical inventory or count of all
assets, fixed, current, and deferred, is made. The books furnish only
the accounts receivable and the cash. All other assets are usually made
up by physical count and reappraisal. It is consequently very easy to
lose sight of some assets, particularly in the case of additions and
betterments to existing assets. For the deferred items, the inventory
of supplies on hand supplemented by the proprietor’s memory is the
customary source.</p>

<p><b>Liabilities.</b>—Liabilities are more difficult of correct
determination. The accounts payable are shown on the ledger, the notes
payable should be shown in the bill book or by stubs in the bound
blank book of notes. Any unpaid bills may be found in the current file
of unpaid invoices if one is maintained. For all other liabilities,
including deferred income, the memory must serve. The haphazard manner
in which this statement must be made up is therefore apparent.</p>

<p><b>Accrued and Deferred Items.</b>—There is usually little or
no notice taken of accruals and deferred items on account of the
difficulty in securing trustworthy and full information. The theory of
averages, viz., that these items at one period will offset, in the long
run, those at another, is the theory by which the failure to include
accruals and deferred data is excused. A comparison of this method with
the double-entry method for handling similar items throws into strong
relief the inaccuracies of the single-entry method.</p>

<p><b>The Balance Sheet and the Determination of Profit.</b>—The balance
sheet, listing all assets and all liabilities, makes a determination of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>
proprietorship or net worth possible. Under the inventory and appraisal
method it must be taken periodically. A comparison of the net worths
as shown by successive statements develops the gain or loss for the
period, provided no other elements affecting net worth have become
involved. The additional element to be taken into consideration is
the relation of the proprietor to the funds of the business. He may
have withdrawn some of the assets or he may have made additional
investments, so that the condition of the assets as shown at the end
of the period is not entirely the result of business activities and
transactions.</p>

<p>Profits determination by this method, therefore, must take cognizance
of the two factors: (1) comparative net worths, and (2) proprietor’s
interim drawings and investments. A withdrawal of cash during the
period equal in amount to the profits for that period would result
in the same net worth at the close as at the opening of the period.
Drawings in excess of profits would cause a net worth less at the end
than at the beginning; and withdrawals less than profits would cause an
increased net worth. But under none of the three cases stated would a
comparison of the two net worths show the actual profits.</p>

<p>Similarly, additional investments have an opposite effect, bringing
about an increase in closing net worth in the exact amount of the
additional investment and so obscuring the true amount of profit or
loss for the period. Accordingly, the increase or decrease of net
worth as shown by the comparative statements of financial condition
must be adjusted in accordance with the proprietor’s withdrawals and
additional investments to make a correct determination of profits. To
determine the profits for the year, to the change in net worth—treated
algebraically, i.e., positive if an increase and negative if a
decrease—must be added the withdrawals, and from this sum the
additional investments must be subtracted.</p>

<p><b>Single and Double Entry Compared.</b>—From the foregoing discussion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
and from the illustrations in the next chapter it will be seen that
single entry can be worked through to a conclusion as to profit and
loss. It tells nothing, however, of the sources of that profit or
loss, nor does it give any control over expenses. It is true that a
comparative statement of assets and liabilities as shown in Chapter
IV, presenting increases and decreases of the various assets and
liabilities, will give additional information, but even that does not
show the reasons for the change and so affords no basis for control.
For such purposes the statistical totals of the sales and purchase
records, and of the cash book, where analytical columns are used,
furnish the only information available under single entry. Its only
advantage, then, is brevity, the saving of labor in making the record.
No difficult analysis is met with in the original record and posting is
a less heavy task than in double entry. But brevity and labor-saving
are secured at the expense of the very information which the business
man needs.</p>

<p>The advantages of double entry may be summarized as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1. The ledger shows a classified record of every
transaction.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2. Expenditures for capital purposes, i.e.,
for new assets or additions and betterments to existing assets, are
recorded as such, so that there is no danger of losing sight of
them.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3. A gross profit figure is obtainable and
percentages of profits and expenses, making possible an <i>estimate</i>
of merchandise inventory at any time. This is particularly valuable in
case of fire loss.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">4. The double-entry method provides a proof of
the mathematical accuracy of the ledger.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">5. A full statement of sources of profits and
causes of expenses can be obtained in double entry.</p>
</div>

<p>Where the above advantages and information are not desired nor
necessary, as in a very simple business under the immediate supervision
of the proprietor, or in simple executorship transactions, etc., single
entry may suffice.</p>

<p><b>Change from Single to Double Entry.</b>—If it is desired to change
from single to double entry, all that is necessary is a complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
inventory and appraisal, to be used as the basis for an opening journal
entry, debit and credit, as for any opening entry. If the former
single-entry ledger is to be used, only the items not already posted,
i.e., the impersonal items, will be posted from this opening entry. The
proprietor’s account should first be adjusted to its correct figure
by a determination of profits by the single-entry method. If this is
done, no posting to his account is needed from the opening entry for
the double-entry books. This opening entry posted will bring the ledger
into equilibrium, which will be maintained under the double-entry
method. If a new ledger is to be used, the opening entry above referred
to will be posted completely—personal and impersonal items—which
will of course bring about the equilibrium desired. Thereafter all transactions
will be analyzed and entered according to the double-entry system.</p>

<p><b>Opening Entries.</b>—In opening a set of single-entry books,
as complete a record should be made as under double entry. If the
proprietor begins business with an investment of cash only and without
any obligations, an entry in the cash book of the amount invested as a
credit to the proprietor’s capital account is all that is necessary. If
the investment consists of a variety of properties and liabilities to
creditors, and obligations on leases, salaries, etc., are assumed, a
very careful and complete record should be made in the journal, showing
the kinds and values of the properties invested, and the kinds and
amounts of the liabilities assumed. This is best arranged in schedule
or statement form, with extension into the posting money columns only
of those personal items for which accounts are to be opened in the
ledger. Illustration will be given of a simple set of single-entry
books, the journal, cash book, sales and purchase records, and the
ledger. In order that the entries may be traced, a separate statement
or diary of the transactions will be given, covering in summarized form
a six months’ period.</p>

<p class="space-above2"><b>Net Profits.</b>—Inasmuch as the change
in proprietorship is determined only by a comparison of the two
financial statements, at least the result of the comparison should be
incorporated into a journal entry and so be brought into the ledger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
account. Sometimes the statement itself and the calculation of change
in net worth are made on the face of the journal, thus making permanent
record of them. This is worth while since they are an essential part of
the system. A permanent statement book will accomplish the same result.
In the illustration the statement is entered in the journal. The net
profit of $2,259.50 may be set up in the proprietor’s personal account,
and the balance of that account, being the amount of profits retained
in the business, transferred to the capital account; or the net amount
left in the business may be transferred directly to the capital account
and the personal account ruled off without balancing as suggested in
<a href="#Page_495">Chapter LIII</a>. The same result is accomplished,
but the ability to prove postings against the books of original
entry is lost. Hence the first method which is the one shown in the
illustration is the better.</p>

work. Practice work cannot be properly done unless the principles on
which it is based have been developed and explained. Practice work
should, so far as possible, follow closely after the explanation of new
principles. This applies particularly to the introductory work of the
first half-year. Later work is cumulative in its effect and may use
all principles previously developed as well as the new principles just
developed.</p>

<p>The practice work for the first half-year consists largely of
disconnected problems. However, a few longer problems running through
several assignments are included. Effort has been made to keep to a
minimum the purely mechanical work of computation. While emphasis
should be placed always on the principles involved, the need for
accuracy should not be lost sight of; in its practice in business,
accountancy requires accurate and, where possible, proven results.</p>

<p>Of the budget of stationery provided for this work, the loose-leaf
supplies—statement, journal, and ledger paper—are for the first
half-year’s work. The three-column paper is to be used for balance
sheet and profit and loss statements, unless other directions are given
for particular assignments. The use of journal and ledger paper is
indicated where necessary. Observance of directions given and of forms
to be followed, together with careful and accurate work in drafting
solutions, will save much time in the location and correction of errors.</p>

<p>Sufficient practice work is furnished to accompany 30 hours of lecture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
or classroom work, opportunity being provided for two review periods,
one at mid-term and one at the close of the semester. Where the lecture
period is two hours in length—the class usually meeting but once a
week—two of these assignments should be given to accompany each such
lecture period. The student should make his solutions as a part of his
home-work and these should be taken up for discussion at the next class
session and correct solutions should be presented there so that always
the student may have a criterion with which to compare his own work.
Where more practice work is desired than is provided in this appendix,
a collection of miscellaneous problems is given in Appendix C.</p>

<p>1. Make up three problems, using your own data, to
illustrate the three types of business organization.</p>

<p>2. On January 2, 19—, Allen B. Dawes has in his business
the following assets and liabilities which you are to
classify for balance sheet purposes according to the
definitions which have been given, changing the descriptions
here used to standard titles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">Alongside of a railroad spur, on a plot 100 by 75
feet, costing $2,500, Dawes has erected a plant for $12,000, for a part
of which he is still indebted to the Mutual Savings Bank, which debt is
secured by a claim for $5,000 against the property.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">In the plant Dawes has installed stationary
operating apparatus amounting to $19,750, and loose operating parts and
supplementary devices amounting to $250.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">The value of the models and patterns which
he uses amounts to $1,215.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">His stock, totaling $12,215, is in three distinct
phases or conditions:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">Raw materials $4,305.</li>
<li class="isub3">Partly finished or in process goods $4,020.</li>
<li class="isub3">Completed stock $3,890.</li>
</ul>

<p class="neg-indent">In the plant Dawes has $725 worth of furniture.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">In the bank he has a balance of $940 and $83.50
in the safe.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Some of his customers owe him for goods bought,
the total being $5,397.50 on open account and $875 on signed promises
to pay.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">Dawes owes creditors on account $4,857.50.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">He has formally acknowledged and accepted
drafts amounting to $543.50.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">He is liable for a pay-roll of $150,
earned but not yet due.</p>

<p>Draw up a statement showing assets, liabilities, and net worth,
using standard titles.</p>
</div>

<p>3. Dawes has reached a point where it is not only profitable
but really necessary to expand his business if he is to retain the
good-will of his old customers and secure new ones. He has therefore
persuaded Edward A. Robbins, a capitalist, to put cash into the
business equal to Dawes’ net interest and so become a partner with him.</p>

<p>The partnership uses $3,100 of this new capital to purchase
additional raw material, and $2,500 for some partly finished stock
(bought at a sacrifice sale). They spend $1,600 for new machinery,
$250 for tools, and $100 for new patterns. With an eye toward future
building facilities they acquire another and adjoining strip of
property with a building on it. The latter costs them $5,470 and
the land $2,500.</p>

<p>To facilitate securing and delivering goods, the partners invest
$1,800 in a small truck. They add shop furniture amounting to $80.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span></p>

<p>These various deals were consummated by the early afternoon of
January 2, 19—. The partners ask you for a new balance sheet to show
the condition of the business and the respective interests of each.</p>

<p id="PROBLEM_4">4. At the end of the year’s operation, Dawes &amp; Robbins
ask you to draw up a statement of assets, liabilities, and net worth,
the following figures being submitted:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub1">Balance of cash in the bank $28,000.</li>
<li class="isub1">Accounts owing the partnership $12,000; notes $6,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">The inventory is again split up into:</li>
<li class="isub3">Raw materials $9,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">Partly finished goods $5,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">Finished stock $500.</li>
<li class="isub1">Still on hand unused:</li>
<li class="isub3">Advertising material $640.</li>
<li class="isub3">Oil, waste, and supplies $500.</li>
<li class="isub3">Packing supplies $750.</li>
<li class="isub1">Other assets:</li>
<li class="isub3">Models and patterns $500.</li>
<li class="isub3">Loose tools $75.</li>
<li class="isub3">Shop furniture is to be shown at the last balance sheet figure</li>
<li class="isub4">less an estimated depreciation in value of $161.</li>
<li class="isub3">Machinery in the same manner less depreciation of $2,669.</li>
<li class="isub3">Delivery equipment less depreciation of $360.</li>
<li class="isub3">Factory less depreciation of $3,498.</li>
<li class="isub3">Land as it was on the last balance sheet.</li>
<li class="isub1">Liabilities are as follows:</li>
<li class="isub3">Accounts owing to creditors $1,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">Notes $250.</li>
<li class="isub3">Accrued pay-roll $200.</li>
<li class="isub3">The mortgage had been reduced to $2,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Robbins is anxious to withdraw from active participation in
the partnership. To facilitate this and to secure additional funds
with which to buy new models and other things needed for the growing
business, it had been decided some time ago to incorporate and to
dispose of some of the stock to outsiders. The necessary steps had
already been taken. In accordance therewith the corporation takes
over the business at the values shown in the balance sheet of
<a href="#PROBLEM_4">Problem 4</a>, with the exception of $14,252 cash
which Robbins retains. For the good-will of the business the
corporation gives the partners $15,000 of its capital stock. $25,000 of
the capital stock is sold to outsiders for $25,000 cash. The rest of
the capital stock is used in purchasing the partnership.</p>

<p>Set up the balance sheet of the corporation.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>III</b></p>

<p>1. A. K. Sutton is proprietor of hardware store. On June 30, 19—,

<p>On the above date Sutton buys out the automobile accessory business
of his neighbor, A. M. Lawrence, and combines it with his own. The deal
was completed on the basis of the balance sheet submitted below, except
that Lawrence is to retain the cash. Sutton pays Lawrence in cash from his
hardware business. Lawrence’s balance sheet contains the following items:</p>

<ul class="index">

<p>Problem 1. A ledger “T” account is a skeleton account ruled only
with the horizontal “title” line and the vertical line separating the
left section from the right, date and amount columns being left without
formal ruling.</p>

<p>Problem 3. The illustration on <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a> gives the

merchandise turnover of 5, and a gross profit of 40% of sales. From
these determine roughly the cost of goods sold, the purchases, and the
sales figures. Make reasonable provision for bad debts, depreciation,
interest, etc., in accordance with the balance sheet requirements. Make
the other expense items whatever amounts are necessary to produce the
same net profits as is shown by the comparative balance sheet.</p>

<p>As bookkeeper for Wm. C. Baldwin, dealer in coal and coke, you will
use a general journal, a sales journal, a purchase journal, a cash
book, and a ledger. Four <i>double</i> pages of journal paper and three
<i>double</i> pages of ledger paper will suffice. At the top of the
first page write “Journal of Wm. C. Baldwin.” Allow 130-150 lines for
your Journal. The next blank <i>double</i> page will be used for a cash
book, marked on the left at the top, “Dr.” and near the middle, “Cash.”
Similarly the right page, “Cash”; and at the top, right-hand margin,
“Cr.” Allow 80-100 lines for each side of the cash book. The next blank
page mark “Sales Journal,” allowing 70-90 lines. The next blank page
mark “Purchase Journal,” allowing 1 page. The last 3 pages, reserve
for trial balances and statements. Number consecutively all pages in
journal and ledger.</p>

<p>In the cash book use the first column on either side for items and
the second column for totals and balances. <i>Balance and rule the cash
book at the end of each week</i>, extending the “items” total before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
balancing and marking it for posting purposes “Cash, Dr.” or “Cash,
Cr.” as the case may be. Enter the balance on the “Dr.” side in the
“Total” column, and so keep each week’s receipts segregated. At the
bottom of the page, unless it happens to coincide with the end of the
week, carry “totals” of each side forward, not the balance.</p>

<p>In the sales and purchase journals mark the first column “On
Account” and the second “Cash,” and make entries in them according as
sale or purchase is “on account” or “cash.” If “cash,” entry must be
made in the cash book also, in which case check the item in the ledger
folio column in both journals, as total cash, sales, and purchases are
to be posted from their respective journals. In making summary entries
for the sales journal at the end of the month, rule and total each
column, and bring the cash column total over on the next line into the
“On Account” column, marking it “Cash Sales, Total.” Add these two
and rule off, marking them “Sales, Cr.” The purchase journal will be
handled similarly.</p>

<p>Open the following accounts in your ledger, beginning on the first
page in the order given and allowing the number of lines to each
account indicated by the numeral following each:</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Instructions</i></p>

<p>May 14. The coal given to charity is a personal expense of
Baldwin’s.</p>

<p>May 31. Record the purchase of lot and building as a credit for the
entire amount to the vendor. Cancel the liability to the vendor by
entry in the cash book for the cash portion, and in the general journal
for the mortgage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span></p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XXVI</b></p>

<p>Balance the cash book, total, and make summary entries for the sales
and purchase journals.</p>

<p>Post completely the sales and purchase journals, then the general
journal and cash book. Be sure to post the weekly totals of cash
receipts and cash disbursements as well as the totals for the end of
the month.</p>

<p>Take a trial balance of account balances and record it on page 13 of
your journals, labeling it</p>

<p class="center">“Trial Balance, May 31, 19—, Wm. C. Baldwin.”</p>

<p>Refer to pages <a href="#Page_142">142</a>, <a href="#Page_148">148</a>,

for the method of summarizing.</p>

<p>Be very careful always to cross-index every posted item in both
ledger and journals just as soon as the posting of that item is
completed. The ledger folio columns in the journals are thus an
indication as to how far the work of posting has proceeded, in case
the bookkeeper is interrupted before completing the postings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX B<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PRACTICE WORK FOR STUDENT—<br />SECOND HALF-YEAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The practice work for the second semester is designed to give facility
in the use of accounting records, and accuracy and confidence in the
handling of a volume of transactions. Accordingly, this work consists
largely of two somewhat extended problems to be recorded in blank
books. The first is a problem in partnership, involving particularly
the adjustment of partners’ accounts at the close of the fiscal period.
Many points met in the operation of records using controlling accounts
are included. The second is concerned with a trading corporation. Here
some of the problems peculiar to the corporation are met, as well as
those connected with the operation of a departmental business.</p>

<p>The stationery furnished provides two sets of blank books, as indicated
above, the one for the partnership, the other for the corporation.
Specific directions for their use are given with each problem. Upon
completion of the problem these blanks are to be turned in for
inspection and may be retained by the school if deemed best. A few
miscellaneous problems are also provided. The loose-leaf supplies will
usually be found suitable for their solution.</p>

<p>Here, also, sufficient practice work is furnished to accompany 30 hours
of lecture or classroom work. If desired, this may be supplemented by
the use of material in Appendix C. If an adequate understanding of the
use and operation of accounting records is to be secured, disconnected
problem work should not be substituted for the practice work provided
in this Appendix B.</p>

<p>In handling this semester’s work, the student must not allow himself to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
fall behind in the preparation of the assigned work There is quite a
volume of work to be done and the material of the various assignments
is so interrelated that unless the practice work is kept up to date,
most of its value is lost through the student’s not being ready to
carry out instructions given covering the current work. Careful work
and the proving of its accuracy will prevent much waste of time in
making corrections.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>I</b></p>

<p>This set comprises a general journal; a sales journal, a purchase
journal, and the cash journals, for convenience bound together in
one book; and a general ledger, purchase ledger, and sales ledger,
also bound together in one book. Of the general journal, pages 1-15
inclusive will be used for transactions which cannot be recorded in the
special journals, the rest of the blank being used as a place of record
of the monthly trial balances. Of the special journal blank, pages 1-4
inclusive will be used for sales; pages 5-7 inclusive for purchases;
page 8 and following for the cash book. For the purpose of securing a
better comprehension of some features of the operation of controlling
accounts the general journal is not provided with the customary
analysis columns. The student is thus compelled to consider the effect
of each entry on the controlling account as well as on the subsidiary
account.</p>

<p>The sales journal provides for the analysis of sales into cash,
credit, and partners’ withdrawals, the first column being the total or
general column in which all items are to be entered; the others, “On
Account,” “Cash,” and “Partners’ Withdrawals.” The same provisions,
with the exception of the Partners’ Withdrawals column, are to be made
in the purchase journal.</p>

<p>The cash book columns will be, on the debit side, General, Accounts
Receivable, Sales Discount, and Net Cash; and on the credit, General,
Accounts Payable, Purchase Discount, and Net Cash. All items affecting
the controlling accounts, “Accounts Receivable” and “Accounts Payable,”
are to be entered gross in their respective columns, the totals of
which are posted to the controlling accounts when the cash book is
summarized. The discount columns on both sides of the cash book are
to be used for the recording of sales and purchase discounts, and
all items to be posted to general ledger accounts other than the
controlling accounts should be entered gross in the “General” columns.
All amounts will be extended net into the “Net Cash” columns, and
the difference between these two columns will represent the cash
balance.</p>

<p>The general ledger will include pages 1-27 inclusive, the sales
ledger pages 28-34 inclusive, and the purchase ledger 35-40 inclusive.
The first four pages preceding ledger ruling are to be used for index
purposes.</p>

<p>All transactions affecting individual customers’, creditors’, and
partners’ accounts are to be posted daily to those accounts. The
postings to the controlling accounts will follow the explanations in
the text or special instructions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span></p>

<p>This set affords the student facility in handling a partnership set
of books operated under a controlling account system. The operation
of this set will require great care in posting to controlling and
subsidiary accounts in order to keep them in agreement.</p>

<p>To secure the maximum of practice with a minimum of detail work,
the transactions for each month are summarized and are to be dated as
of the last day of the month. The dates of issuance or maturity of the
notes, however, are given so that this can be recorded.</p>

<p class="space-below2">The student should become familiar with the
following ledger accounts to which he should strictly adhere in the
classification of all transactions. These accounts are to be opened in
the ledger at the places indicated. The first numeral following the
account title indicates the page, the second the line on that page.
“Line 1” refers to the very first line at the top of the page.</p>

<p>Cotten guaranteed the collection of all notes and accounts
outstanding, and the partnership agreement provided that in case any
of the accounts should be judged uncollectible by agreement among
the partners or otherwise, such amount is to be charged to Cotten’s
personal account on the date such items are found uncollectible.</p>

<p>Wooster’s investment was $20,000 cash, his services and experience;
and Woolsey was admitted as a special partner investing $50,000 in
cash.</p>

<p>The partnership agreement further provided that Cotten was to be
allowed an annual salary of $4,800, Wooster $6,000, but Woolsey was
to receive no salary; and that interest at the rate of 6% per annum
was to be charged on the drawings in excess of the salary allowed for
the fiscal period from the date such drawings exceeded salary until
the date of closing the books. The drawings of Woolsey were also to be
charged at 6% per annum from the date of draft to the date of closing
the books. Interest at 6% per annum was to be allowed on capital,
and in all cases was to be figured on the basis of 360 days to the
year, 30 days to the month. Profits and losses were to be shared as
follows: Woolsey 20%, Cotten 36%, and Wooster 44%. The fiscal period
was to consist of six months, ending on June 30 and December 31,
respectively.</p>

<p>The partnership agreement also provided that the capital accounts
of the partners were to remain intact and that any credit balances
remaining in the partners’ personal accounts at the close of the
fiscal period were to be transferred to their loan accounts which were
to be treated as current accounts bearing 6% interest and subject to
adjustment of interest at the close of each fiscal period.</p>

<p>Make the necessary entries in general journal and cash book to
record the respective investment transactions, and post.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Instructions</i></p>

<p>Make a <i>full</i> but <i>concise</i> statement of the partnership
agreement, following the form of opening entry illustrated on <a href="#FORM_15">page 166</a>.
This opening statement is the first record in the general journal and
should provide all of the information needed by the bookkeeper for the
proper handling of the partners’ accounts at the close of the fiscal
period.</p>

<p>Immediately following this narrative will be the formal investment
entries. On the line just preceding the formal investment entry for
each of the partners, use the following—or similar—phraseology: “C.
Allen Cotten made the following investment.” A separate investment
entry is made for each partner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span></p>

<p>These entries are to be made complete in the general journal and
posted immediately, except the several cash items, which, included in
the totals of the cash book, will be posted at the end of the month.
These cash items will therefore be checked both in the journal and in
the cash book, where they must be entered in the “General Ledger” and
“Net Cash” columns.</p>

<p>Summarized transactions for the month of January were as follows.

<p>All cash transactions are to be entered in the cash book whether
listed under “Cash” above or not. In recording a cash sale or cash
purchase in the cash book, extend the amount into the “General Ledger”
and “Net Cash” columns only.</p>

<p>Be sure to classify and post all items correctly, inasmuch as
a wrong classification or posting may necessitate many correction
entries.</p>

<p>The claim against the railroad company will be charged to Sales
Returns and Allowances until a settlement is effected. Such items are
often charged to a Freight Claims account, with suitable adjustment to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>
Sales Returns and Allowances when settlement is made for less than the
amount claimed.</p>

<p>The word “balance,” as in the phrase, “Falk &amp; Taylor, balance of
January bill $5,447.60 less 2%,” calls attention to an adjustment of
some sort—returns or allowance—which has been or is to be considered
in determining the amount still due.</p>

<p>Charge the freight and haulage to In-Freight and Cartage.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised in the general journal entries
affecting individual customers’ and creditors’ accounts, since these
also affect their respective controlling accounts. Inasmuch as the
general journal does not provide the customary analytic columns, it
will be necessary, when making every such entry, to indicate the
controlling account affected and, when posting, to post the item both
to the individual account and to the control account. The following
illustrations should be followed in making entries of this kind:</p>

<p>Summarize the sales, purchase, and cash journals; balance the cash
book.</p>

<p>In summarizing the sales journal, first total each column and
draw a horizontal line under these amounts. On the next line record
the summary entry, entering the amounts to be debited in the first
money column and those to be credited in the second. The total of the
partners’ withdrawals should not be posted, for they have already been
transferred to the general ledger accounts at the time they occurred.
The amount will therefore be checked in the summary entry. The total
cash sales will also be checked, inasmuch as these have already been
recorded in the cash book. The summary entry for the sales journal will
appear as follows:</p>

<p>The purchase journal should be summarized somewhat similarly but
the total purchases are to be debited to “Purchases,” the purchases on

<p>In summarizing the cash journals, pencil-foot all columns of both

journals. Then formally foot the columns on both sides, using the same
line on both sides, i.e., the totals must appear on one line extending
across both pages of the book. This may leave blank lines on either
side according as one has had more entries than the other. Underline
the totals. Make summary entries somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>Use the first two money columns on either side for the entry of the
amounts. Underline these entries through the four money columns. When
posting these summary entries, the items “General” on either side will
be checked as the details composing them have already been posted.</p>

<p>On the next line write in the Explanation columns on either side,
“Net Cash as above,” and extend the total amounts of cash receipts
and cash disbursements into the Net Cash columns on their respective
sides. Balance the cash book by entering “Balance” on the disbursements
journal and extending the amount in the Net Cash column. Show totals at
the same level on both sides and draw double lines through all columns
on both sides except the Explanation columns. Bring the cash balance
down in the receipts journal.</p>

<p>Post completely all books of original entry. When posting the
general journal, be very careful to post to the indicated controlling
accounts. <a href="#A_3_III_INS">See Assignment III, Instructions</a>,
for the method to be followed.</p>

<p>Take a trial balance of your general ledger and record it under date
of January 31, beginning on page 16 of the journal blank. Write “Trial
Balances, 19—” at the top of the page and in the small space over the
money columns “January 31.” From the general ledger, copy the names of
all accounts, whether or not there are as yet any entries in them, in
the order there shown. Do not include the individual customers’ and
creditors’ accounts in the above list, for these are taken care of by
the inclusion of their controlling accounts. Be careful to write the
account name at the extreme left of the explanation space, close to the
date column. Leave one line at the bottom of page 16 and at the top of
page of 22 for “Totals” and “Totals Forward.”</p>

<p>Since one page is not sufficient to complete the record, continue it
on page 22, there recording the rest of the accounts and heading the
page and columns as on page 16. The intervening pages will be used as
shown in <a href="#A_VI_B">Assignment VI</a>.</p>

<p>Prove the controlling accounts against their subsidiary accounts.
To make this proof, at the top of page 30 of the general journal,
write “Balances of Accounts Receivable, 19—” and list the names of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span>
customers’ accounts, writing the account name to the extreme left of
the explanation space, close to the “Date” column. Place the words
“January 31” in the small space over the first money column, in which
the balances of accounts receivable for January will be recorded. Do
not use the second money column on this page; this will be used for
February balances.</p>

<p>Beginning on page 34, make a similar list of creditors’ accounts. The
instructions covering the listing of accounts receivable apply here
also, with the exception that the words “Accounts Payable” are to be
substituted for “Accounts Receivable.”</p>

<p>List the individual account balances of customers’ and creditors’
accounts for each month, as described above, and record the total of
each list in their respective columns. These totals must agree with the
balances shown in the corresponding controlling accounts, i.e., the
total of customers’ accounts outstanding for January must be equal to
the balance of the controlling account, “Accounts Receivable,” shown in
the general ledger. A discrepancy between a controlling account and its
subsidiary accounts must always be located and corrected.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Instructions</i></p>

<p>In making general journal entries affecting customers’ or creditors’
accounts, be sure to indicate the posting to the corresponding
controlling accounts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span></p>

<p>At the time the freight bills are paid, the total amount is charged
to In-Freight and Cartage. They are analyzed later into freight paid on
sales and in-freight, and the amount paid on sales is transferred to
the proper account by means of a journal entry.</p>

<p>Record the sale of miscellaneous ends and the like in the cash
receipts journal and post to Miscellaneous Sales.</p>

<p>Charge the $10 fine to Delivery Expense.</p>

<p>Be careful to charge the accrued interest on Liberty bonds to the
proper account.</p>

<p id="A_VI_B" class="f120 space-above2"><b>VI</b></p>

<p>Summarize the special journals. In summarizing the cash receipts
journal for February and the following months, do not underline the
totals of the General and Net Cash columns, as instructed in <a href="#A_IV_B">Assignment IV</a>.
Deduct the balance as of the first of the month from the totals
shown in both columns, indicating, in the explanation column, the
nature of this amount. (<a href="#FORM_37">See page 282 for illustration</a>.)
Underline these amounts and write the summary entry for the cash
receipts journal as previously explained, taking care that the Cash
account is debited only with the receipts of the current month.</p>

<p>Post completely, being particularly careful in handling items
affecting controlling accounts, especially when posting the general
journal.</p>

<p>Take a trial balance of the general ledger as of February 28. In
making record of this and succeeding trial balances, to obviate the
necessity of rewriting account titles, fold back the two money columns
on page 17 so that they “face up” on page 18, thus providing four
money columns. This shortened leaf may now be used for recording trial
balances for February and March. Similarly with succeeding leaves.</p>

<p>Do not fail to record the balances of customers’ and creditors’
accounts in the proper places, and prove the totals against their
respective controlling accounts.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Instructions</i></p>

<p>Include the discount received on advertising with the purchase
discounts. The charge to Advertising will, therefore, be gross.</p>

<p>Be sure to make the purchase discount adjustment necessitated by
the returned goods transaction with Marshall Field &amp; Co. Though this
and the returned goods are to be taken into consideration when the
note is paid, do not enter them now in the Notes Payable account, that
adjustment being made at time of payment of note. Enter them in the
Marshall Field &amp; Co. account.</p>

<p>Disregard the depreciation adjustment on the desk transferred to the
sales department.</p>

<p>Record the face of the discounted note in the General Ledger column,
the amount of discount in the Sales Discount column with an (X) mark,
and the net amount in the Net Cash column. In summarizing the cash
book, this discount should be segregated from the total to be posted
to Sales Discount, inasmuch as the former will be posted to Interest
Cost.</p>

<p>Credit the overcharge on demurrage to In-Freight and Cartage.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>X</b></p>

<p>Summarize the journals. In summarizing the debit side of the cash
book previous to posting, remember that included in the Sales Discount
column is an item of bank discount on the firm’s $5,000 note, which
must be shown separately and charged to Interest Cost. Be sure you show
this in the summary entries, in addition to the Sales Discount summary.
To accomplish this the total of the Sales Discount column is best shown
in two portions, the Sales Discount total on the one line, and the
Interest Cost item on the next line.</p>

<p>Post completely.</p>

<p>Take a trial balance of the general ledger as of April 30.</p>

<p>Prove the subsidiary accounts against their respective controlling
accounts.

<p>The item “Net Profit as above” is taken from the work sheet. The
Profit and Loss columns, in conjunction with the detailed distributions
shown in the “Partners’ Personal” columns, contain all the data needed
for the appropriation section of the profit and loss statement and also
for distributing the net profit shown by the Profit and Loss account.
By entering the drawings in the “Partners’ Personal” columns, those
columns are made to develop the amount of undrawn profits of each
partner. They thus contain the same information which the respective
personal accounts will contain after the ledger is closed. The work
sheet, with this appended analysis of profits and partners’ personal
accounts, thus contains all of the information needed both for drawing
up the formal statements and for adjusting and closing the books.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XVI</b></p>

<p>Draw up a pro forma balance sheet and a statement of profit and loss
for the six months for Cotten, Wooster &amp; Company. In drawing up the
balance sheet, head it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author"><i>Exhibit A</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cotten, Wooster &amp; Company<br />
Balance Sheet</span><br />June 30, 19—</p>
</div>

<p>Show the total of all customers’ accounts as “Accounts Receivable
(See Schedule A-1).” Attach to the balance sheet a list or schedule of
all customers’ accounts to support the title “Accounts Receivable
(See Schedule A-1),” carried in the balance sheet. Give to it as a
formal heading:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author"><i>Schedule A-1</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cotten, Wooster &amp; Company<br />
List of Accounts Receivable</span><br />June 30, 19—</p>
</div>

<p>The data for the schedule come from the customers ledger list or
trial balance for June 30.</p>

<p>Attach schedules also for the other groups of items appearing in the
balance sheet, viz.: Deferred Charges to Operation under which include
in addition to the other items listed, the office supplies and packing
materials still on hand; Accrued Income; Accounts Payable; and Accrued
Expenses.</p>

<p>The use of schedules relieves the balance sheet of much detail and
renders it more intelligible; it also makes the detail available if desired.</p>

<p>Excepting for the Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
schedules, the detailed data for balance sheet and profit and loss
statements come from the work sheet drawn up for <a href="#A_XV_B">Assignment XV</a>.
Set up the formal statements on letter size (8½ × 11) paper. Typewrite them if
possible.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XVII</b></p>

<p>Using the “Adjustment” columns of the work sheet as a guide, make
the adjusting entries in the general journal.</p>

<p>Using the profit and loss statement (including the appropriation
section) as a guide, set up the closing entries in the general journal.
Use the “Profits Distribution” section of the work sheet as the source
of the transfer of the balances of the partners’ personal accounts to
the loan accounts.</p>

<p>Post the adjusting and closing entries.</p>

<p>Rule the ledger accounts.</p>

<p>Take a post-closing trial balance of the general ledger.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XVIII</b></p>

<p>This set comprises a general journal; a sales journal, a sales
returns and allowances journal, a purchase journal, a purchase returns
and allowances journal, and the cash journals, for convenience bound
together in one book; a note journal to be used as a posting medium for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</span>
notes receivable and notes payable; and a general ledger, a purchase
ledger, and a sales ledger, bound together in one book. Of the
subsidiary journal blank, page 1 is for the sales journal, page 2
the sales returns, page 3 the purchase journal, page 4 the purchase
returns, and pages 6-9 the cash journals. Of the ledger blank, pages
1-15 comprise the general ledger, pages 16-19 the sales ledger, and
pages 20-22 the purchase ledger. The general journal will be used as
previously, i.e., for the record of all items not otherwise specially
provided for. The sales journal provides for analysis of the sales,
the first column being the total or general column; the others, Dept.
A, Dept. B, and Out-Freight, respectively. The sales returns and
allowances journal makes provision for the same analysis as the sales
journal except that there is no Out-Freight column, that not being
used; the purchase journal columns are respectively, Total, Dept.
A, Dept. B, and In-Freight, with the same column headings for the
purchase returns and allowances journal, except as to In-Freight. The
cash book columns will be, on the debit, General, Accounts Receivable,
Sales Discount, and Harding National Bank; and on the credit, General,
Accounts Payable, Purchase Discount, and Harding National Bank. The
note journal will be analyzed, summarized, and posted just as the other
subsidiary journals.</p>

<p>The deposit account carried with the Coolidge National Bank is an
inactive one. For this reason no extra column is provided for it in the
cash book.</p>

<p>Daily posting of items affecting customers’ and creditors’ accounts
should be made, carefully observing the terms of credit.</p>

<p>The general journal is provided with six money columns, three of
which are to be devoted to charges and the other three to credits. The
debit columns are to be headed, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable,
and General, respectively. The credit columns will be headed similarly
but in the reverse order, having the General column close to the ledger
folio column. All amounts to be posted to accounts in the general
ledger should be recorded in the General column, and those affecting a
controlling account in its respective column. The latter amounts should
be posted to the subsidiary account immediately, but will not be posted
to the controlling account until the general journal is summarized at
the end of the month. Record will be made of transactions for the last
month of the fiscal year, the previous eleven months being summarized
in the trial balance given to start with.</p>

<p class="space-below2">The Business Equipment Corporation was
organized and incorporated under the laws of the state of New York.
Its fiscal year closes on December 31. A trial balance from the
general ledger on November 30, 19—, shows as follows:</p>

<p>Since the items making up the “General Ledger” totals have already
been posted, these totals will be checked and will not be posted.</p>

<p>In summarizing the sales journal, the cash sales need not be
segregated from the credit sales in the summary entry, inasmuch as
the inclusion of such receipts in the total to be posted to Accounts
Receivable from the cash receipts journal will eliminate the inflation
of the claims against customers shown by the controlling account.</p>

<p>The purchase journal will be summarized in the same way as the sales
journal.</p>

<p>The items shown on the bank statement but not yet entered in the
cash book are to be entered there before summarizing the cash book.
<a href="#Page_562">See page 562</a> for instructions as to its summary.</p>

<p>For summarizing the other journals follow the explanations given in
<a href="#Page_272">Chapter XXXI</a>.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XXII</b></p>

<p>Post completely.</p>

<p>Take a trial balance of the general ledger, recording it on a
double sheet of journal paper. When posting customers’ and creditors’
accounts, make sure that the corresponding controlling accounts will
receive, either in totals or in items, the same amounts.</p>

<p>Prove your sales and purchase ledgers and record the proof with the
general ledger trial balance, i.e., make a list or schedule of the
accounts and show the list totals as agreeing with their respective
controlling account balances in the general ledger trial balance.</p>

<p>A formal account sales will not be rendered till completion of sales
of entire consignment. The quantities of unsold articles reported
showed, upon pricing, a valuation of $600. Word was also received that
a check for the amount due on sales as above would follow immediately
after certification by the bank. It was decided to defer one-half of
the above expenses reported by the consignee as applicable to the
remainder of the consignment.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors declared the regular semiannual dividend of
4% on the preferred stock, payable January 25, and a 4% dividend on the
common stock, also payable January 25.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="#Page_447">Chapter XLVIII</a> of the text as
to consignments. In this case make use of the Consignment Accounts
Receivable account for recording the claim against the consignee, and
be careful to charge the proper amount of expenses against the income
to be taken into the earnings for this period. Handle the deferred
expense items on the consignments in the Out-Freight account. Do not
forget to adjust the memorandum accounts so that they will show the
value of goods still out on consignment, and take the latter amount
into consideration when setting up the final inventories on the books.</p>

<p>In preparing the schedules of expenses, refer to the previous

Expense accounts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</span></p>

<p>Analyze the Interest and Bank Expense account into expense
and income, and show these items separately in the
statements.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XXV</b></p>

<p>Adjust and close the ledger through the general journal in
accordance with the data given in <a href="#A_XXIII_B">Assignment XXIII</a>.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>XXVI</b></p>

<p>1. The sales of the Radcliffe Company last year January to June,
amounted to $752,465. It is estimated that the price level for
the current year will be 10% lower than a year ago. Due to plans
for increased publicity and sales effort, it is expected that the
<i>volume</i> of sales for the corresponding period this year will be
15% larger than last year’s. The average rate of turnover is 3½ and the
mark-on is 35%.</p>

<p>What will be the average amount of capital required to finance the
merchandise stock?</p>

<p>2. In establishing a buying quota for a three-month period, the
Gotham Novelty Company has available from its records the following
data: present inventory at retail $79,800; sales corresponding period
last year $316,000; estimated sales volume this year same as last but
15% less in value. It is thought that the rate of turnover can be
increased. It is therefore decided to reduce the stock carried so that
at the close of the period there will be on hand a stock 20% less in
volume.</p>

<p>Assuming that the price level is 15% less at the end of the period
and that the mark-on is 40%, determine the company’s buying quota for
the period.</p>

<p>3. The sales representative of the Natty Uniform Company is making
his regular call on the Salem Dry Goods Co., whose buyer has just
secured the following data from the accounting department:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">Salesroom stock on hand at beginning of period $32,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">Additions to salesroom stock to date $45,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">Sales to date $52,000.</li>
<li class="isub3">Stocks in transit and on present order $15,000</li>
<li class="isub3">There is no stock in the warehouse.</li>
<li class="isub3">Planned sales for the period are $75,000 but a revised</li>
<li class="isub5">estimate calls for a 10% increase.</li>
<li class="isub3">Stock planned to be on hand at the end of the period</li>
<li class="isub5">is $25,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the buyer open to buy and, if so, how much?</p>

<p>4. Your Notes Receivable account shows $25,000 of customers’ notes
on hand. Being in need of cash you discount $10,000 of these at the
bank, receiving therefor a credit of $9,750 in your bank account.
Fifteen days later the bank notifies you that $4,000 of these notes
have been paid by their makers at maturity, but that a note for $1,000
signed by J. B. Grant has been charged back on account of non-payment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</span></p>

<p>Make all the entries, in journal form, to record the above.</p>

<p>5. On April 1, 19—, Jones of Trenton, N. J., ships an invoice
of goods to Smith in New York. The goods are valued at $2,000, and
the consignor pays freight amounting to $40, and insurance $30. The
consignee pays cartage amounting to $50, and storage $40. On April
2, Jones draws a 30-day draft against Smith for $500, which is duly
accepted on April 5. The goods are sold for $2,700. Smith’s commission
is 5%.</p>

<p>Set up the necessary accounts both on the books of the consignor
and on those of the consignee properly to reflect the above
transactions.</p>

<p>6. Prepare the closing entries for the following consignment sale.
The consignment was received July 8, account of William Nevins &amp; Co.,
showing an invoice value of $3,750. You paid freight and cartage
$87.50, and insurance $18.75. Sales were made July 16, $1,000, and
July 25, $1,525, on a 5% commission basis. On July 31, upon closing
your books, you inventory the unsold balance of the consigned goods as
$2,500.</p>

<p>7. From the following data, relating only to customers and
creditors, prepare as of December 31, 19—, Accounts Receivable and
Accounts Payable accounts. Indicate in folio column the book of
original entry from which each item is obtained.</p>

<p>3. J. B. Brown and L. C. Smith are partners, and in order to
raise more capital and to preserve the organization they decide to
incorporate. A company was duly incorporated under the name of The
Eclipse Company, with an authorized capital of $800,000 divided into
8,000 shares of the par value of $100 each.</p>

<p>The partners agreed to sell for the sum of $800,000, payable in
capital stock of the corporation at par, all rights to and title in the
net assets of the partnership, exclusive of the cash, which was divided
between the partners in proportion to their several interests at the
time of the sale of the property.</p>

<p class="space-above2">It was agreed that the partnership would be
dissolved as at October 31 of the same year, but that Alexander would
continue the business. It was further agreed that Deas would be paid
the balance to his credit at June 30, 19—, together with a sum of
$5,000 to cover his interest in the good-will of the business and his
profit up to October 31, which latter was estimated at $1,200. From
this amount, however, his drawings, amounting to $800, were to be deducted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</span></p>

<p>The following balances were shown on the books at June 30 of the
next year: Cash in Bank and on Hand $8,310; Accounts Receivable
$12,203; Inventories $29,143; Buildings and Equipment $8,103; Accounts
Payable $8,706.</p>

<p>You ascertain that on April 30 of this year, merchandise valued in
the books at $500 was destroyed by fire. As this loss was not covered
by insurance, Mr. Alexander reduced the book value of his inventory to
take care of the loss.</p>

<p>The additions to the buildings and equipment during the year cost
$503, but the book value of these assets was reduced by the sum of $400
to take care of depreciation.</p>

<p>Alexanders personal drawings during the year amounted to $2,500.</p>

<p>You are instructed to prepare a balance sheet for Alexander as at
June 30, 19—, a year after the balance sheet first given, together with
statement showing profit or loss for the year and the distribution of
same. You are also required to write up Alexander’s capital account for
the year to June 30, 19—.</p>

<p>No value is to be placed on the good-will.</p>

<p>4. A machine costing $12,000 was estimated to have a life of twelve
years with a residual value of $1,500. At the close of each year a
charge of $875 was made to depreciation, and a like amount credited
to “reserve” for depreciation. Just prior to closing the books at the
end of the twelfth year the machine was discarded and sold for $2,000
(cash) and a similar machine was bought, costing $16,000. Show the
journal entries you would frame to make the proper record.</p>

Moore decides to retire from active business and agrees to sell his
interest to the other two partners for $26,400, taking $14,400 in
cash and the balance in three equal instalments payable July 2, 1921,
January 2, 1922, and July 2, 1922, evidenced by notes payable.</p>

<p>The business is very prosperous, but it becomes increasingly evident
that more capital is required, especially in view of the approaching
maturity of the first note given to Moore. New and Knott decide to
admit John Less as partner as of date July 1, 1921, at which time the
current assets have increased by $16,000, accounts payable by $10,000,
and the partners’ capital accounts by $6,000. They value the good-will
at $12,000.</p>

<p>Less buys a one-third interest, but stipulates that all he pays must
remain in the business and that the good-will shall not appear upon the
books.</p>

<p>How much must he pay for the one-third interest? Present the balance
sheet of the firm of New, Knott &amp; Less as of July 1, 1921. (Ignore
accrued interest on Moore notes.)</p>

<p>8. A, B, and C are partners. A is to receive a salary of $2,000 per
annum, B $2,500, and C $3,000. The balance of profits, after payment of
salaries, is to be divided as to the first $20,000, 2/3 to A, and 1/6
each to B and C; and profits above $20,000 are to be divided equally
among the three. A retires from active business, and gives up his right
to salary for 19—. The profits for the year, before charging salaries,
amount to $35,000. To what extent are A, B, and C, respectively,
affected by A’s concession?</p>

<p>9. A and B, partners, finding themselves in want of further capital
in their business, and both being possessed of real property, A
deposited deed with the bankers of the firm as security for a loan of
$2,000 to the firm. B arranged on some of his own property a mortgage
for $1,500 with a private friend and paid the proceeds into the firm’s
bank account. The bankers were eventually obliged to realize the
security held by them which produced, after payment of all expenses,
the sum of $2,850.</p>

<p>Prepare entries recording these transactions in the firm’s books.</p>

<p>10. In making an audit of the books of the partnership of A and B,
you find that the agreed division of profits was to be on the basis of
the capitals and of the time that they were left in the business.</p>

<p>The books show as follows: A’s account paid in January 1, $6,000;
March 1, $2,000; June 1, $4,000; November 1, $1,000; withdrew April 1,
$3,000; October 1, $2,000.</p>

<p>B’s account, paid in January 1, $4,000; February 1, $1,000; August
1, $3,000; withdrew May 1, $2,000; December 1, $1,000.</p>

<p>Prepare a statement showing method of arriving at correct profit
distribution.

<p>11. Bull and Bear entered into partnership, Bull contributing
$100,000, and Bear $75,000. Profits and losses were to be divided, Bull
60% and Bear 40%, and interest was to be allowed on capital at the rate
of 6% per annum. The profits for the first two years (after charging
interest on capital) were $19,600 for the first year, $22,400 for the
second; and the drawings of the partners in excess of their salaries
were, Bull $1,800 first year, $2,000 second year; Bear $2,000 first
year, $2,400 second year.</p>

<p>At the end of the second year, Peak was admitted to partnership, and
put into the business capital equal to Bull’s capital at the time, on
the same conditions as to interest. Profits were to be divided on the
basis of capital.</p>

<p>The profits for the third year were $30,000, and the partners’ drawings
in excess of salaries were: Bull $2,000, Bear $2,500, and Peak $1,500.</p>

<p>Set up the capital accounts of the partners for each of these years,
showing balance of each at the end of the third year.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><span class="smcap">Partnership—Dissolution</span></p>

<p>12. A, B, and C are in partnership. A invested $11,000; B
invested $5,000 and C invested $1,200. Their agreement provides that
profits or losses shall be divided as follows: A, <big>⁴/₉</big>; B,
<big>³/₉</big>; and C, <big>²/₉</big>.</p>

<p>The partnership has become insolvent and has therefore decided
to dissolve. The cash value of assets is $10,000. The deficit is,
therefore, $7,200. How should the assets be divided and how much money
will each partner receive?</p>

<p>13. A, B, and C engage in business. A contributes $10,000 capital; B
contributes $5,000; while C in lieu of any capital contribution agrees
to undertake the active management at a salary of $3,000 a year, to be
paid monthly.</p>

<p>After allowing 5% interest on capital, they are to divide the net
result in the proportions of 5, 3, and 2 respectively.</p>

<p>At the end of eighteen months they ascertain the position to be
unfavorable and decide to wind up. The assets realize $12,500; there
are no liabilities except for capital and interest thereon and one
month’s salary, due to C.</p>

<p>Make up the partners’ accounts showing the amount to be received by
each.</p>

<p>14. Thompson and Murray are partners, sharing profits and losses
equally. The partnership is dissolved December 31, 19—, at which time
Thompson’s capital investment is $20,000, and Murray’s $7,000. Total
liabilities are $55,000, included in which is $5,000 due Wilson on open
account, and $7,000 due Murray on account. The whole of the assets had
been disposed of for $60,000 cash by July 1 of the next year. Close the
partnership books.</p>

<p class="space-above2">From a comparison of the financial statements
at the beginning and the end of the year, you find that the item of
“Plant and Equipment” is stated in an amount less by $11,460 than it
was at the beginning of the year, plus additions during the year.</p>

<p>The financial statement for the beginning of the year showed a
surplus of $35,703.</p>

<p>From your analysis of the disbursements and unpaid accounts at the
beginning and end of the year, you find total purchases amounting to
$661,910, and expenses for salaries, wages, supplies, repairs, etc.,
amounting to $120,115.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</span>
The purchases, however, included $450 paid out for John Smith, an
employee, for which he has not reimbursed the company; and the total
expense of $120,115 included $250 in the hands of a buyer as a working
fund.</p>

<p>The inventory of merchandise at the beginning of the year was
$18,125 and of prepaid expense was $2,653.</p>

<p>There was canceled on the customers ledger during the year $3,206 of
uncollectible accounts.</p>

<p>There was paid for interest and discount on notes payable $1,061,
and for interest on mortgage $1,500.</p>

<p>A 10% dividend was declared but not paid.</p>

<p>From the foregoing prepare: (a) a balance sheet as at December 31,
19—; (b) a profit and loss statement exhibiting net sales, cost of
sales, and gross and net profit for the year.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><span class="smcap">Interest, Discount,

<p>39. What single rate of discount is equivalent to the series 20%,
20%, and 15%? 50%, 25%, and 15%?</p>

<p>40. An invoice amounting to $1,000 reads: “Less 30%, 10%, and 5%.
Terms 2/10, n/30.” It is dated January 19, 19— and paid January 28, 19—.</p>

<p>Explain and distinguish between these reductions of the list price.
Give the amount of the check sent in payment of the invoice.</p>

<p>41. Keene owed Sharpe $2,000. Sharpe offered a discount of 5% cash.
Not having the ready money, Keene discounted his note at the bank for
60 days at the rate of 6%, the note producing the sum required to
discount Sharpe’s claim.</p>

<p>Calculate the amount of this note and make the necessary journal
entries to take care of the entire transaction.</p>

<p>42. Equate the following account and find the cash balance due
October 1, money being worth 7% per annum, 30 days to the month.</p>

The student should note the manner of showing depreciation reserves
in the comparative balance sheet. This is done solely for the
purpose of eliminating the detail column in the assets needed to
handle the subtraction item. This method of showing is countenanced
only in comparative statements where saving of space is a chief
consideration.</p></div>

Light, heat, and power expense should in strict theory be distributed
over the departments using it; the selling department to be charged
with its share and the general administrative with its share. Where
such procedure is difficult or undesirable, the expense is best
classified as above.</p></div>

Whatever agreement is made by the partners for interest adjustments
governs. In practice the usual procedure in a case of this kind would
be to allow C interest on the $890 cash advanced by him for expenses
from date of advance to date of settlement, and to charge him with
interest on all moneys received by him from dates of the various sales
to date of settlement. To simplify calculations, it is assumed in the
illustration that C’s use of funds received from sales during the first
five months approximately compensates him for the $890 advanced by him.</p>
